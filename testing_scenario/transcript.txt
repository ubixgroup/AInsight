D: What brings you here today?

P: Hi, I've been having this back pain for the past month

D: Is this the first time you're having this back pain?

P: Yeah yes.

D: OK and where exactly are you having the back pain?

P: It's in my lower back. 

D: OK, and what kind of pain are you experiencing?

P: It's kind of dull and achy

D: OK. And is this back pain constant, or does it come come and go?

P: It's pretty constant, but it gets worse with certain things.

D: What line of work are you in?

P: I work in this factory where I move a lot of boxes

D: OK, I see and how long have you worked in this role?

P: For the past 30 years.

D: OK. Alright, so those are all the questions I had for you today. Do you have any questions for me? 

P: No, just like how can I treat this?

D: Yeah, for sure. So this has been going on for the last month. It sounds more like what's called mechanical back pain and due to the nature of your heavy work. And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging. Is that OK with you?

P: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

D: You're welcome, alright take care.
