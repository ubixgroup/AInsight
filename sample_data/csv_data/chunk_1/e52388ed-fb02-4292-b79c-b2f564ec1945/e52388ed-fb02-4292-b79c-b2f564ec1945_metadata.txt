Notes: DEHA
Di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA) is widely used as a plasticizer in food contact materials, such as PVC food wrapping or cling films used to rewrap meat poultry, fish, cheese, and other foods. DEHA can also be found in PVC gaskets of lids for glass jars. Like other plasticizers, DEHA is not chemically bound to the polymer and has been found at very low levels in foods due to migration from the cling films. Repeated oral exposure to DEHA may be associated with liver, kidney, reproductive, and developmental effects. Although an adequate margin of safety exists for current exposure to DEHA via foods, Health Canada conducts targeted surveys of DEHA in foods to better define Canadian exposure to DEHA through dietary intake. If a potential concern to human health is identified, immediate and appropriate action will be taken.


Phthalates are a group of diesters of phthalic acid (dialkyl or alkyl aryl esters of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid). Higher molecular weight phthalates, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are primarily used as plasticizers to soften polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products, while low molecular weight phthalates, such as di-ethyl phthalate (DEP), may be used in various consumer and personal care products. Some phthalates are also used in food contact materials, such as DEHP in PVC gaskets of lids for glass bottles and jars, PVC cling films, and PVC milk tubing, and low levels can migrate from food contact materials into foods, especially fatty foods, since phthalates are not chemically bound to the polymer. The human health effects of DEHP and other phthalates include potential developmental and reproductive effects as well as effects on the liver and kidneys. The levels of exposure associated with these health effects are much higher than current Canadian exposure levels to DEHP and other phthalates and therefore, the human health risks from these substances is considered low. Surveillance results indicate that DEHP levels in various foods have decreased over the last few decades. Health Canada continues to monitor the levels of DEHP and other phthalates to ensure that exposure from food remain within acceptable levels. Although an adequate margin of safety exists for current exposure to DEHP and other phthalates via foods, if a potential concern to human health is identified, immediate and appropriate action will be taken.
