Notes: The determination of the trace element concentrations in food is important for consumer safety. Trace elements are metals that are present in low concentrations in air, water and soil. Thirty-four trace elements are commonly measured in TDS food sample composites. Although mercury and fluoride measurement results are not available on the open data portal, they can be found in the references below. Health Canadaâ€™s Bureau of Chemical Safety, Food Directorate leads the Canadian TDS program.
