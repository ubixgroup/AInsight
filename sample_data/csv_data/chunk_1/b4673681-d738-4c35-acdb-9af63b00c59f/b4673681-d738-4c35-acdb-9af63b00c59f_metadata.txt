Keywords: ['Air Quality', 'Bike', 'cycling', 'ultrafine particles', 'UFP', 'particulate matter', 'PM 2.5', 'nitrogen oxide', 'NO2', 'ozone', 'O3', 'Ottawa', 'exposure']
Notes: A cross-over study was conducted among 42 healthy adults during the summer of 2010 in Ottawa, Canada. Participants cycled for 1 hour along high and low traffic routes and ultrafine particles (UFPs) 0.1um in aerodynamic diameter, particulate matter (PM2.5) 2.5 Âµm in aerodynamic diameter, and black carbon were measured along each cycling route. Ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) levels were recorded from a fixed-site monitor.
