Notes: The Food Consumption Table (FCT) provides estimates of daily intakes of foods (means and percentiles) obtained using data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Nutrition. Estimates were generated at three different food grouping levels based on the food group list from the Bureau of Nutritional Sciences, Food Directorate, Health Canada. These estimates are presented for two consumption populations: “all persons” and “eaters only”. Each estimate is further broken down by various age-sex categories. For both consumption populations, estimates are available in two different units: 1) grams per person per day and 2) grams per kilogram of body weight per day. The User Guide, Read Me file, Food Group List and Body Weights table provide detailed information to facilitate use of the FCT.
