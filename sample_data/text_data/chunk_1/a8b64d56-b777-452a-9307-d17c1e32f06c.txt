The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify compliance of toys with specific magnetic force requirements of the Toys Regulations. For this project, compliance of select toys with the Toys Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors sampled relevant products from online establishments. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating this CV project, the CPSP carried out market survey to determine the presence of toy companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2021-2022 fiscal year, mechanical testing of 6 different products was carried out. The testing resulted in 3 recalls and one public advisory which included 3 products. Corrective action was required in all instances as all 6 products that were sampled were non-compliant. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
