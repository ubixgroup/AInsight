Deleted files Update files tables Added files Changed files Deleted files Introduction The downloadable files comprising the Canadian Nutrient File database are relational files available in two formats: Excel files and csv files. In order to view and utilize these files one must both own and be familiar with a database management software program or a spreadsheet program of sufficient capacity. New for this version we will also be offering the database as a downloadable Microsoft Access file in which the tables have been joined and common queries created. To save space and speed up downloads; the files are zipped into one large file with a file name ending with '.exe'. This is the file that is downloaded to whatever directory the user specifies. After downloading, go to that directory and double click on the exe file; this will extract the many files comprising the CNF database. Some database management programs require you to "open" these files into their programs while others require them to be "Imported". Once they are imported, the corresponding tables can be joined using the common fields indicated in the File Relationships section below. New for this edition New food code Over time, CNF users tend to get used to the numeric code associated to certain foods, and start to refer to these foods using their code. In the CNF database, this familiar, unique food code (FD_CODE in the FOOD_NAME table) is not the primary key. All primary key fields end with _ID (FC_ID) in the CNF database in order to be easily identified. Food code field structure and roles Field Description of field New role in the database Will appear in the web search application FoodID Food ID field or food identifier This is the primary key and the link for joining related tables No Food code Food code This is the user food code Yes It is recommended that the Food ID and other primary keys be used only to link tables and that the Food Code be displayed and used for searches. Remember that all of the nutrient data is stored per 100 g of the food. If you want to manipulate the data to display weights per portion, this can be done through some sophisticated calculated field programming. If you are not familiar with these terms you may want to buy a nutrient analysis software program which features 2015 CNF data. 2015 File Relationships File Relationships The 2015 file relationship diagram shows the links between the twelve files comprising the Canadian Nutrient File and identifies the primary keys used to link the files together. There are five principal files which are shaded in grey: Food Name, Nutrient Amount, Yield Amount, Refuse Amount and Conversion Factor. The seven support files are: Yield Name, Refuse Name, Measure Name, Nutrient Name, Food Group, Food Source and Nutrient Source. The Food Name file links to the Yield Amount, the Refuse Amount, the Conversion Factor and Nutrient Amount files using the FoodID field. The Food Name file links to the Food Group file using the FoodGroupID field. The Food Name file links to the Food Source file using the FoodSourceID field. The Nutrient Amount file links to the Nutrient Source file using the NutrientSourceID field. The Nutrient Amount file links to the Nutrient Name file using the NutrientNameID field. The Yield Amount file links to Yield Name file using the YieldID field. The Refuse Amount links to the Refuse Name file using the RefuseID field. The Conversion Factor file links to Measure Name using the MeasureID field. Description of files Name File name File description Food name Food name This is a principal file. It stores information about each food in the database. It contains a description of each food in English and French as well as dates and comments. Nutrient amount Nutrient amount This is the main file. It uses information (by linking) from the food name table (among others) to identify which nutrients and amounts are recorded for that food. Conversion factor Conversion factor This is a principal file. This file contains portion size conversion factors. The conversion factors are food specific multipliers by which the nutrient values for each food may be multiplied to give the nutrients in described portions. Refuse amount Refuse amount This is a principal file. This file contains the percent of refuse, or inedible portion, for each food. Yield amount Yield amount This is a principal file. This file contains the yield from refuse and/or cooking losses assigned to certain foods. These yields are most often used for food inventory purposes. Food group Food group This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the food name table. It contains a list of 23 different group headings (in English and French) based on similar characteristics of the foods. Food source Food source This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the food name table. It contains a list of several food sources (in English and French) that foods can be grouped on. Nutrient name Nutrient name This file is a support or "list" table that contains the list of nutrients (in English and French) used in the NT_AMT file, with which it is linked. Nutrient source Nutrient Source This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the nutrient amount file. It contains a list of several sources and/or types of nutrient data (in English and French). Measure Measure name This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the conv fac table. It contains a list of measures (in English and French). Refuse name Refuse name This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the refuse table. It contains a list of refuse types. Yield name Yield name This file is a support or "list" table that is used to link to the yield table. It contains a list of yield types or yield descriptions (in English and French).

It is recommended that one also downloads the entire database for reference.
