1. Introduction
Many Canadians consume dietary supplements; based on the 2015 CCHS – Nutrition survey,
45.6% of Canadians age one and older consume dietary supplements.1 The estimates found in
the Total usual nutrient intakes from foods and dietary supplements (2015 Canadian Community
Health Survey – Nutrition) data tables describe Canadians’ overall intakes of nutrients found in
food and in commonly consumed dietary supplements such as vitamins, minerals, fibre
supplements, antacids, and fish oils.

2. Methodology
2.1 Data Source
Total usual intake estimates were calculated using data collected from Canadians in the CCHS
– Nutrition. Two main components are used in the evaluation of total usual intake estimates:
intakes from food and intakes from dietary supplements. In order to maintain consistency with
the previously published Usual Intakes from Food for Energy, Nutrients and Other Dietary
Components (2004 and 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition), data from both
the 2004 and 2015 CCHS – Nutrition Share Files were used in the modelling of intakes from
food. Intake from dietary supplements were available only using the data from the 2015 CCHS –
Nutrition as respondents in the 2004 survey were not asked about their use of dietary
supplement during the 24-hour recall portion of the interviews.
The survey excludes from its target population those living in the three territories, individuals
living on reserves, residents of institutions, full‐time members of the Canadian Armed Forces
and residents of certain remote regions.
The analysis excluded respondents with null intakes (zero total intake from food) and pregnant
or lactating females (Figure 1).

2.2 Databases
The nutrient values used were extracted from the Canadian Nutrient File Version 2015 based on
USDA Standard Release 23-27 and the recipe database based on Food and Nutrient Database
for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) 5.0 and some FNDDS 2011-12 to calculate usual intakes from
food. The Licensed Natural Health Products Database was used to calculate usual intakes from
dietary supplements.
2.3 Total usual intake estimation
A three-part mixed effects model was used to estimate total usual intake as described by
Verkaik-Kloosterman et al.6 with slight adaptations. This approach is an extension of the NCI
method used to produce the estimates presented in the Usual intakes from food. The model
was used to estimate and then combine three usual intake distributions: (1) from food for
nonusers of dietary supplements; (2) from food for users of dietary supplements; and (3) from
dietary supplements for users of dietary supplements. Should you require more information,
please reach out to the surveillance team at: nutrition.surveillance-nutritionnelle@hc-sc.gc.ca.
To maintain consistency with the analysis of Usual intakes from food, it was assumed that the
probability of taking a dietary supplement was uncorrelated to the nutrient intake from food. This
assumption allowed for calculation of usual intake from food based on both 2004 and 2015
CCHS – Nutrition using the one-part model provided in the NCI method, as well as the
probability of taking a dietary supplement using the modified two-part model.4,5
The Verkaik-Kloosterman method6 requires reference values of daily nutrient intake from dietary
supplements for each individual. Respondents provided information on dietary supplement
intake on the previous day (24-hr recall) and in the past month. The following approach was
used to derive these individual-level daily reference values:
a) For each individual, if dietary supplements were reported on at least one recall day, then
the amount reported was used as the reference value for daily nutrient intake from
dietary supplements. If dietary supplements were reported on both recall days, the
average amount consumed was used as the reference value.
b) If dietary supplements were not reported for either recall day, the daily amount recorded
for the past 30 days was used as the reference value.
2.4 Estimates
The data tables include estimates for the following nutrients: calcium, folate/folic acid, iron,
vitamin A and vitamin D. Estimates are calculated at the national-level (Canada, excluding the
territories) and include prevalence of supplement use, the arithmetic mean and percentiles (i.e.
P5, P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, P95) of usual intakes for 16 age-sex groups. The percentage of
the population with intakes above or below the DRIs are presented when applicable. For ease of
reference, estimates of usual intake from food alone taken from the Usual intakes from food for
energy, nutrients and other dietary components (2004 and 2015 Canadian Community Health
Survey - Nutrition) are also included.
Nutrient-specific considerations include:
• Folate: The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folate applies only to synthetic forms
obtained from dietary supplements, fortified foods, or a combination of the two. The
prevalence of excessive intakes (% above UL) was estimated based on usual intakes of folic
acid from foods + dietary supplements.

Methodology document| 5
• Iron: Estimation of iron inadequacy was done using the full probability method as described
in section 2.3.4 of the Methodology document: Usual intakes from food for energy, nutrients
and other dietary components.3
• Vitamin A: No prevalence of intakes above the UL are shown for vitamin A. The UL for
vitamin A applies to preformed vitamin A only and these intake estimates are not yet
available.
• Vitamin A and D: Corrections were made to amend errors of Vitamin A and D values in the
2015 CCHS – Nutrition dataset due to the way they were documented in the Licensed
Natural Health Products Database (LNHPD).
• Vitamin D: All vitamin D supplements from the 2015 CCHS – Nutrition dataset were included
in the analysis whether available as over the counter or higher-dose prescription vitamin D.
All estimates were adjusted according to the instructions from Statistics Canada by using the
sampling weights provided in the 2015 CCHS Nutrition data files in order to reflect the intakes of
the Canadian population.7
3. Comparability with other published estimates
Several methods are available to estimate total usual intakes by incorporating nutrient intakes
from dietary supplements and foods.8 These methods differ primarily in how they handle
measurement error and each method will generate slightly different results. BDSKI deemed the
current approach (i.e., three-part mixed effects model) the most appropriate for analysis of
CCHS – Nutrition data considering sample characteristics, total sample size and proportion of
the sample that use dietary supplements. Other factors can affect the results of the analysis of
total usual intakes including covariates included in the model and data source (i.e., master file
vs. share file).

Appendix A. Table footnotes
The following footnotes apply to the data tables:
1. The survey excludes from its target population those living in the three territories,
individuals living on reserves, residents of institutions, full‐time members of the
Canadian Armed Forces and residents of certain remote regions.
2. The table excludes pregnant and lactating females, subject to another set of nutritional
recommendations.
3. Sample size is based on the first 24‐hour recall (first day of interview) only.
4. The intake distribution was estimated using a three-part mixed effects model (extension
of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Method). The model was used to estimate and
then combine three usual intake distributions: (1) from food for nonusers of dietary
supplements; (2) from food for users of dietary supplements; and (3) from dietary
supplements for users of dietary supplements.4,5
5. Bootstrap weights provided by Statistics Canada were used to produce the coefficient of
variation (CV) and the standard error (SE).
6. EAR is the Estimated Average Requirement. In the context of reporting results in a
population-based survey such as the 2015 CCHS-Nutrition, the primary use of the EAR
is to estimate the prevalence of inadequacy of some nutrients in a group. For further
information on EAR and how to interpret the prevalence of inadequacy in a population
see the Health Canada publication The Reference Guide to Understanding and Using
the Data - 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition, Section 2.2.2.2
7. UL is the Tolerable Upper Intake Level. The level of intake at the UL is the highest
average daily intake level that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects to almost
all individuals in the general population. For further information on UL and how to
interpret the prevalence of intakes above the UL in a population, see the Health Canada
publication The Reference Guide to Understanding and Using the Data - 2015
Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition, Section 2.2.5.2 In 2017, the Guiding
Principles for Developing Dietary Reference Intakes Based on Chronic Disease
recommended that the UL be retained in the expanded DRI model, but that it should
characterize toxicological risk.9
8. For a more detailed understanding of DRIs and their interpretation when assessing
intakes of particular nutrients, consult the summary of the series of publications on DRIs
published by the Institute of Medicine: Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide
to Nutrient Requirements, (2006).10
9. In terms of precision, the estimate 0.0 with a standard error of 0.0 refers to a standard
error smaller than 0.1%.
10. We assigned the following symbols based on the data release guidelines of Statistics
Canada:
a. Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified as
follows: (E) use with caution.

b. Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% with a 95%
confidence interval entirely between 0 and 3% are identified as follows: <3
interpret with caution.
c. Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed due
to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to
be published.
