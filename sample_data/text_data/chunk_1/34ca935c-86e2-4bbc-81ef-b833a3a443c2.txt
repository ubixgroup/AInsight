WHMIS classification Health hazards: Acute Toxicity (Inhalation) – Category 4 Skin Irritation – Category 2 Reproductive Toxicity – Category 2 Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure – Category 3 (Narcotic Effects) Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure – Category 1 Aspiration Hazard – Category 1 Physical hazards: Flammable Liquids – Category 2 Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Does not meet criteria Median lethal dose (LD50 ): 4,328 mg/kg (female rat) Footnote 1 . In a well-conducted study, the LD50 for combined male and female rats was reported as 4,632.8 mg/kg and as 4,328 mg/kg for females alone. Administered doses for males and females were 3,000, 4,000, 4,500 and 5,000 mg/kg (and an additional dose group of 4,250 mg/kg in the females). Per dose, 5 rats per sex were used, except 10 males at the 4,500 mg/kg dose level and only 5 females at the 4,250 mg/kg dose level. Clinical signs included depression, ataxia, salivation, prostration, hunched posture, red stains on nose/eyes, tremors, lacrimation, wheezing and laboured respiration. Mortality: 2 of 5 female rats died at 4,250 mg/kg and 4 of 5 females died at 4,500 mg/kg Footnote 1 . The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral). Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50 : 12,200 mg/kg (rabbit) Footnote 2 . In an acute dermal toxicity study with no study details available, the LD50 in rabbits was 14.1 mL/kg (multiplied by a specific gravity of 0.866 Footnote 3 equals 12,200 g/kg) Footnote 2 . No information on clinical signs or mortality were provided Footnote 2 . The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable Toluene is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): Category 4 Median lethal concentration (LC50): 19.0 mg/L (female rat, 4-hour) Footnote 4 . In a non-guideline acute inhalation study (good laboratory practices (GLP) not specified), groups of 6 rats were exposed to toluene vapours for 4 hours. The LC50 was reported as 19.0 mg/L. No other study details or clinical signs were provided Footnote 3 . The available data for toluene vapours meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation) – Category 4 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Category 2 An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 404 study was conducted in 6 male rabbits Footnote 5 . A volume of 0.5 mL of undiluted toluene was applied under occlusive conditions for 4 hours and an irritation response was measured at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours, and 7, 14 and 21 days after patch removal. Mean scores (24, 48 and 72 hours) of ≥ 2.3 (2.8/4) for erythema and 2.1/4 for edema were reported across all 6 animals. The results of this study meet the classification criteria for Skin Irritation – Category 2 as per HPR 8.2.2(3). Toluene was reported to be slightly irritating with a primary cutaneous irritation index of 2.13/8 in another study Footnote 6 . No individual scores were provided. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Irritation – Category 2 [HPR 8.2.2(3)]. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Does not meet criteria Multiple guideline studies are available that have reported toluene as not being an eye-irritating substance Footnote 5 Footnote 7 Footnote 8 Footnote 9 Footnote 10 . In an OECD TG 405 study in 6 rabbits, the mean scores (24-48-72 hours) were 0.1/2, 0.1/4, 1.3/3 and 1.6/4 for iritis, corneal opacity, conjunctival redness and chemosis, respectively Footnote 5 . In another well-conducted study, application of 0.1 mL of 100% toluene in 4 rabbit eyes resulted in scores at all time points of 0 for cornea and iris and average scores of < 2 for conjunctiva Footnote 7 Footnote 10 . These findings are further supported by in vitro studies showing no effects Footnote 11 Footnote 12 . The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation. Respiratory Sensitization: No data available Skin Sensitization: Does not meet criteria Humans: The results of closed patch tests performed on 5 control subjects and on 4 painters experiencing repeated episodes of skin eruptions revealed no evidence of skin sensitization Footnote 13 . However, this study cannot be used for classification since toluene was only one of several substances in the paint mixture and was not tested separately. Animals: In the only available guinea pig maximization test performed in accordance with EU guideline B.6, toluene was reported to be non-sensitizing to the skin Footnote 14 . Guinea pigs (n=20) were injected intradermally with a 10% concentration of toluene or exposed epidermally to the undiluted toluene. All animals were challenged 2 weeks later with 50% (maximum non-irritant concentration) and 25% toluene, and vehicle (corn oil). Only 1 guinea pig out of 20 experienced a grade 1 reaction (discrete or patchy erythema) in response to the 50% solution. The rest of the guinea pigs showed no reaction. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria Humans: Peripheral lymphocytes have been analysed in multiple studies from workers exposed to toluene in printing plants. The results were equivocal across the studies. Confounding factors include the inks used in the various plants as well as the significant contribution of smoking Footnote 15 Footnote 16 Footnote 17 Footnote 18 Footnote 19 . Exposure to low levels (within the admissible limits) of toluene for short periods of time to 5 healthy male adults caused no significant effects on sister chromatid exchange, cell cycle delay or cell mortality Footnote 20 . Animals: Toluene did not induce either dominant lethal effects or sperm morphological abnormalities in mice when administered via inhalation Footnote 14 . High purity toluene, when injected intra-peritoneally in rats at dose levels of 22, 71 or 214 mg/kg, did not induce chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells Footnote 21 . Rats exposed to a thinner, a mixture containing 3,000 ppm of toluene, for 15 min twice per day for 6 weeks did not show any differences in DNA repair when compared to the controls Footnote 22 . Exposure to 100 ppm toluene through inhalation in mice did not result in an increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes when compared to controls Footnote 23 Footnote 24 . In vitro: Toluene tested negative in bacterial cells in Ames assays performed similarly to OECD TG 471 in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA-98, TA-100, TA-1535, TA-1537 and TA-1538, with and without metabolic activation Footnote 25 Footnote 26 Footnote 21 Footnote 27 . When tested in mammalian cell gene mutation assays, toluene tested negative for chromosomal aberrations in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells Footnote 21 , in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in human lymphocytes Footnote 25 Footnote 28 , with and without metabolic activation. Toluene also tested negative in a micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster V79 cells Footnote 29 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria Toluene has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 3 – not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans Footnote 30 . The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) classifies toluene as an A4 – not classifiable as a human carcinogen Footnote 31 . No evidence of carcinogenicity of toluene was found in multiple 2-year inhalation studies with rats and mice Footnote 25 Footnote 32 Footnote 33 . A 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice was inconclusive Footnote 34 . The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Carcinogenicity. Reproductive Toxicity: Category 2 Humans: Multiple case reports are available that describe embryopathy and morphological teratogenicity after toluene abuse in women before or during pregnancy Footnote 35 Footnote 36 Footnote 37 Footnote 38 . High levels of maternal toluene exposure can lead to intrauterine growth retardation Footnote 37 , premature birth Footnote 35 Footnote 37 , spontaneous abortion Footnote 38 Footnote 39 Footnote 40 Footnote 41 , congenital malformations Footnote 35 Footnote 42 Footnote 37 , and postnatal developmental retardation Footnote 35 Footnote 37 . A relatively high exposure of toluene was associated with impairments in language in 2- to 3 year-old children Footnote 35 . Infants with a history of in utero toluene exposure (n=18) were examined at birth Footnote 37 . Of these infants, 9 were re-examined 3 to 36 months after their initial evaluations. Of all toluene-exposed infants, 39% percent were born prematurely, 9% died during the perinatal period, 54% were small for gestational age and 52% exhibited continued postnatal growth deficiency. A 33% incidence of prenatal microcephaly, a 67% incidence of postnatal microcephaly, and an 80% incidence of developmental delay were observed. Most patients (83%) had craniofacial features similar to fetal alcohol syndrome, and 89% of these children had other minor anomalies. Animals: Several reports are available in multiple species, including rats, mice and rabbits. Exposure to 100 or 500 ppm of toluene vapour 6 hours/day or the maximum tolerated oral dose from day 6 to 15 of gestation in rats, mice and rabbits had no significant effect on either the dams or the offspring Footnote 43 Footnote 44 Footnote 45 Footnote 46 Footnote 47 Footnote 48 . In mice, skeletal malformations (extra 14th rib) increased significantly at 1,000 ppm of exposure Footnote 47 . An OECD TG 416, GLP-compliant study involved exposing rats to toluene vapour at 0, 600 or 2,000 ppm (0, 2,261 or 7,537 mg/m3) 6 hours per day, 7 days per week Footnote 43 Footnote 14 . Animals were exposed during an 80-day pre-mating period and 15-day mating period, and females were further exposed on gestational day (GD) 1-20 and lactation days 2 to 5. No adverse effects were observed on fertility, reproductive performance or maternal/pup behaviours during the lactation period in males and females of the parental or first generation. Caesarean section of select 2,000 ppm dams at GD 20, however, showed reduced fetal body weight, high fetal mortality and embryonic growth retardation, but no external, internal or skeletal anomalies were observed in the fetuses of any treated group Footnote 43 . In other studies, rats exposed for 30 minutes, twice daily, from gestational day GD 8-20 to 0, 8,000, 12,000 or 16,000 ppm toluene had significantly reduced fetal growth Footnote 49 Footnote 50 Footnote 51 . Maternal effects included reduced weight gain, immobility and sedation. Fetal gross morphological anomalies, such as short or missing digits, missing limbs and skeletal and soft tissue defects, were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity Footnote 49 . Reduced body weight gain in the parental generation at 2,000 ppm caused reduced fetal weight. This weight reduction persisted in the offspring beyond weaning Footnote 52 . At doses of 3,500 and 5,000 ppm, toluene, administered 6 hours per day on GD 6-15 in rats caused maternal effects (decreased weight gain, food and water intake and narcosis) and some post-implantation loss of embryos Footnote 53 . Overall, the human data are suggestive of a link between toluene exposure and reproductive effects (primarily spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations and decreased fertility/fecundity). However, as the available studies are mostly observational in nature and due to possible confounding factors, only a Category 2 classification is warranted. No data are available on effects on or via lactation. The available data meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity – Category 2 [HPR 8.7.1(1)]. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Category 3 (Narcotic Effects) Oral Route of Exposure: Humans: There is 1 report of a 51-year-old man who died approximately 30 minutes after ingesting a large quantity of an unknown substance which was later identified as toluene by gas chromatography/mass spectrometer Footnote 54 . The probable cause of death was considered to be due to severe central nervous system (CNS) depression. There are reports of 15 deaths by accidental oral ingestion of paint thinner containing toluene over the period of 1977 to 1986 Footnote 55 ; however, the role of toluene cannot be ascertained as it was just one of the components of the paint thinner. Animals: In a single-dose acute toxicity study in rats, a significantly reduced flash-evoked potential waveform indicating a visual dysfunction was seen in male rats (12 rats per dose), 45 minutes following exposure to a single dose of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg toluene by gavage Footnote 56 . The effect, however, was considered to be secondary to changes in arousal or excitability. In another acute oral toxicity study, male rats (20 per group) were dosed with 4.00, 4.56, 5.20, 5.93, or 6.76 g/kg toluene by gavage Footnote 57 . Toluene caused hind limb paralysis and petechial (pinpoint) bleeding especially from the urinary tract, eyes and nose. Epithelial cells of the stomach lining were stripped, and mild acute gastritis was observed in the glandular portion; however, these effects were seen at very high doses that exceeded the LD50 of 4,328 mg/kg. A transient rise in blood pressure was seen in rats with toluene doses of 0.8 and 1.2 g/kg Footnote 58 . Dermal Route of Exposure: Toluene is a volatile compound and rapidly evaporates from the skin after application. Toluene applied in a non-occluded fashion is absorbed through the skin only to a minor extent Footnote 59 Footnote 60 and would not be absorbed in toxic quantities during normal industrial use Footnote 60 . Acute dermal toxicity in the rabbit was found to be low (LD50 : 12,200 mg/kg) Footnote 2 . Inhalation Route of Exposure: Humans: There are reports of narcotic effects and respiratory symptoms observed in industrial workers (from the year 1961-1980) exposed to toluene through paint application, manufacture of chemicals, paints/glue and cleaning Footnote 61 . Headache and dizziness were the most commonly reported symptoms (14-16 of 37 victims of gassing accidents) followed by respiratory symptoms which included cough, breathlessness and chest tightness seen in 10/37 victims Footnote 61 . Cardiac symptoms (tachycardia with normal electrocardiogram) were attributed to toluene by the investigating physician in a case of a 26-year-old worker who felt dizzy and fainted after a sudden escape of toluene vapour for 2-3 minutes Footnote 61 . In a purposely generated human study, 16 young healthy subjects were exposed to a single exposure of 10, 40 or 100 ppm of toluene for 6 hours Footnote 62 . The toluene exposures did not affect nasal mucus flow or lung function at any exposure level. At 100 ppm, there were significantly more reports of headaches, dizziness and feelings of intoxicationFootnote 62 . Similar findings were reported in other human studies Footnote 63 Footnote 64 . Unconsciousness was reported in patients exposed to high concentrations (> 7,000 mg/m3) of toluene in air Footnote 65 Footnote 66 . A statistically significant impairment in reaction time (a psychophysiological function) was noted following an exposure to 300 ppm toluene Footnote 67 . The human data support that the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure – Category 3 (Narcotic Effects) are met [HPR 8.8.1]. Animals: Toluene has been reported to cause CNS Footnote 68 Footnote 69 Footnote 70 and neuro-behavioural effects Footnote 71 Footnote 72 Footnote 73 Footnote 74 following acute exposure. No ataxia or narcosis was observed in rats exposed to a single dose of 4,000 ppm toluene for 4 hours in another study; however, locomotor activity was transiently increased at concentrations of 2,000 ppm and 4,000 ppm, which recovered after 6 hours Footnote 75 . Following a single 4-hour exposure to toluene vapour, a concentration-dependent depression of respiratory rate was observed in mice, with an RD50 of 4,790 ppm or 18 mg/L (where RD50 is the exposure concentration producing a 50% respiratory rate decrease), and disturbance of rotarod performance in rats with an EC50 of 4,050 ppm or 15 mg/L (where EC50 is the exposure concentration producing a 50% decrease in such performance) Footnote 76. The exposure level of toluene used in this experiment was 1 or 2 times higher than occupational exposure limits established for humans. Based primarily on human evidence, the available data meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure – Category 3 (Narcotic Effects) [HPR 8.8.1]. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Category 1 Oral Route of Exposure: In a GLP-compliant, 90-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study performed according to EU Method B.26, rats and mice (10 per sex per group) were administered 312, 625, 1,250, 2,500 and 5,000 mg/kg of toluene in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 13 weeks Footnote 25 . The high doses of 2,500 and 5,000 mg/kg were toxic to the animals as all rats in the 5,000 mg/kg group and 8 of 10 males and 1 of 10 females in the 2,500 mg/kg group died within the first week. There was a 19% decrease in body weight of male rats receiving 2,500 mg/kg compared to the controls. A statistically significant increase in absolute and relative liver and kidney weights was also observed in rats receiving 2,500 and 1,250 mg/kg toluene. Increased relative weights of liver and kidney were interpreted as toxicologically insignificant as they were unaccompanied by histological findings. Similar findings were noted in mice Footnote 77 Footnote 25 . In another well-conducted study, no deleterious effects were found in female rats when fed up to 590 mg/kg of toluene, 5 days per week, for 6 months Footnote 78 . Dermal Route of Exposure: No toxic effects were observed when rabbits were exposed to toluene with 10 to 20 applications onto the shaved abdomen over a period of 2 to 4 weeks Footnote 78 . Inhalation Route of Exposure: Humans: Repeated chronic inhalation of toluene has caused cardiac toxicity leading to instant deaths Footnote 79 Footnote 80 , permanent lung and kidney damage Footnote 81 Footnote 80 , liver injury Footnote 82 Footnote 80 , and CNS effects Footnote 83 Footnote 84 . Chronic toluene use has also caused effects on the senses, such as vision, hearing, and smell Footnote 85 Footnote 86 . Workers exposed long term to low ambient levels of toluene had reductions in short-term memory, sustained attention and concentration, visual scanning and colour perception, perceptual-motor speed, and finger dexterity Footnote 87 Footnote 88 Footnote 89 Footnote 90 . Most of the human data is derived from the use of toluene-containing products such as sniffing glue or in paint workers, but the clinical diagnosis confirmed toluene as the cause of toxicity. The available human data support a Category 1 classification for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure. Animals: In a key study performed according to OECD TG 453 (Combined Chronic Toxicity / Carcinogenicity Studies), toluene did not cause adverse effects in rats following inhalation exposure to 300 ppm for up to 24 months Footnote 33 . In a 90-day inhalation study performed according to EU Method B.29, groups of 10 rats per sex were exposed via inhalation to 0, 100, 625, 1,250, 2,500, or 3,000 ppm (0, 377, 2,355, 4,710, 9,421 or 11,306 mg/m3) toluene, 6.5 hours per day, 5 days per week for 15 weeks Footnote 25 . No adverse effects were observed at 625 ppm and below. The higher doses were toxic to rats. Toluene exposure in mice at an air concentration of 625 ppm, 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 15 weeks caused mortality but no other evidence of significant target organ toxicity Footnote 25 . High levels of toluene exposure from 1,000 to 2,000 ppm (3.8 - 7.5 mg/L), for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks caused hearing loss in rats Footnote 91 Footnote 92 . Toluene also caused neurotoxic effects in rats Footnote 93 Footnote 94 Footnote 95 Footnote 96 Footnote 97 Footnote 98 ; however, these effects were seen at very high exposure levels (1,000 - 8,000 ppm) that exceed the cut-off for classification. Based on human reports, the available data meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure – Category 1 [HPR 8.9.1]. Aspiration Hazard: Category 1 Toluene is a liquid hydrocarbon with a viscosity of 0.56 mPa·s (dynamic) at 25°C (0.65 mm2 /s kinematic; < 20.5 mm2 /s required for classification in Category 1) Footnote 99 .
