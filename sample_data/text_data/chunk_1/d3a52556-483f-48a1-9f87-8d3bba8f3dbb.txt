This is especially important during periods of poor outdoor air quality when you may spend more time indoors as a result. One important step is to install and maintain at least 1 carbon monoxide alarm in your home. Install the alarm(s) near bedrooms and preferably 1 on each floor. Keep outdoor air pollutants out Keep windows and doors closed and use air conditioning (where available) if the weather is warm. Properly seal windows and doors with weather stripping. In homes with forced air ventilation, use a clean, good quality air filter based on the manufacturer's recommendations to help remove fine particles from the incoming air. Keep up-to-date about outdoor air quality conditions in your region by checking: Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) forecasts InfoSmog forecasts for Quebec Active weather warnings and air quality advisories provincial and territorial governments' websites Reduce air contaminants from indoor sources Don't smoke indoors. When possible, limit the use of any combustion source, such as incense and candles. Make sure fuel-burning appliances are installed, maintained and working according to manufacturers' instructions. Use certified portable air cleaners with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration to help improve air quality by removing fine particles that can be a risk to your health. You may have to change or replace filters more often, depending on use and conditions. Avoid devices that produce ozone, as ozone can impact your health. The California Air Regulatory Board (CARB) lists air cleaners that have passed testing for ozone emissions. Address sources of indoor moisture to prevent mould growth. Maintain humidity levels between 30 and 50%, using a dehumidifier as necessary. Consider selecting low emission cleaning products. Some products may emit high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Follow the directions for use and precautions listed on the label. Store cleaning products, paints and solvents in areas away from living spaces. Use a vacuum cleaner with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter. You can remove settled dust by wiping and wet mopping. Wood smoke from wood burning appliances You can be exposed to wood smoke: both indoors and outdoors from your own burning activities or from those of others in your area. If you use a wood stove or fireplace, take steps to reduce the impacts of wood smoke, such as choosing a low-emission stove and burning wisely.
