The purpose of this compliance verification project was to verify industry's compliance of portable firepots with the requirements of the Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001 (CCCR, 2001) and select performance criteria of ASTM F3363-19: Standard Specification for Unvented Liquid/Gel Fuel-Burning Portable Devices (ASTM F3363-19) or the equivalent. For this project, compliance of portable firepots to the CCPSA was determined through the verification of performance criteria outlined in ASTM F3363-19 or the equivalent. Compliance with the CCCR, 2001 was determined through a review of establishment records requested by Health Canada inspectors. Prior to initiating this compliance verification project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of portable firepot companies in Canada. Target establishments were selected from that list of companies and were sent a letter to request documentation under the CCPSA and the CCCR, 2001. During this project, the labels of 12 different products were evaluated for compliance to the selected ASTM F3363-19 criteria or the equivalent, and their CCCR, 2001 documentation was reviewed. This resulted in 6 recalls, 1 public advisory and 5 voluntary removals from sale to address non-compliance. The recalls and the public advisory included more than the 12 originally selected products, as other portable firepots from the same establishments were deemed to be non-compliant. Results Readers should consult the individual recalls and the advisory, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Return to Table 1, footnote a referrer Disclaimer: A systematic bias is applied during inspection and sampling. Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
