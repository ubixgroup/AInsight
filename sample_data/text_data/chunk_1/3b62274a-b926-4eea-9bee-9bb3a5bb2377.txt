Keywords: ['arsenic', 'inorganic arsenic', 'rice', 'diet', 'exposure', 'food', 'maximum level', 'ML', 'children', 'polished', 'husked', 'arsenite', 'asenate']
Notes: Arsenic is naturally occurring in the environment, and very low levels are present in various foods. Elevated arsenic exposure from drinking water has been associated with a variety of serious adverse health effects, with potential effects noted in vulnerable populations such as infants and children. 

Rice and rice-containing products are a major contributor to dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic in all ages, including infants and young children. In June 2020, Health Canada’s Food Directorate issued a Notice of Modification (NOM, NOM/ADM C-2020-1) to add maximum levels (ML) for inorganic arsenic in polished (white) and husked (brown) rice.  These targeted MLs were developed to help ensure that dietary exposures to inorganic arsenic be kept as low as possible.  

In April 2021, Health Canada’s Food Directorate proposed an additional ML for inorganic arsenic in rice-based foods intended specifically for infants and children (NOP/ADP C-2021-1). This document presents the final assessment to support these additional risk management measures for inorganic arsenic in rice-based foods intended for infants and young children.

As a result of this assessment, it is the intention of Health Canada to modify Part 2 of the List of Contaminants and Other Adulterating Substances in Foods, as described in the information document. The purpose of this communication is to publically announce the Department's intention in this regard and to provide the appropriate contact information for any inquiries or for those wishing to submit any new scientific information relevant to Health Canada's proposal. Information Document Health Canada's Proposal to Add a Maximum Level for Inorganic Arsenic in Rice-based Foods Intended Specifically for Infants and Young Children - Reference Number: NOP/ADP C-2021-1 Contact Information Health Canada's Food Directorate is committed to reviewing new scientific information on inorganic arsenic in rice-based foods intended specifically for infants and young children. Anyone wishing to submit new scientific information or submit inquiries on this proposal may do so in writing, by regular mail or electronically. If you wish to contact the Food Directorate electronically, please use the words "Arsenic ML for Infant Rice Foods (NOP/ADP-C-2021-1)" in the subject line of your e-mail. Health Canada is able to consider information received by June 22, 2021, 75 days from the date of this posting.
