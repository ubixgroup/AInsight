The purpose of this Standards project was to sample handheld portable laser pointers and test them to the performance criteria of a consensus-based safety standard in order to verify compliance to the CCPSA. The safety standard used as a basis for the project testing was International Electrotechnical Commission Standard IEC 60825-1:2014 Ed.3, Safety of laser products- Part 1: Equipment classification and requirements. For this project, compliance of select handheld laser pointers was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments and sampled any relevant products. Compliance with the requirements, which were based on the standard, was then verified through testing at the Consumer and Clinical Radiation Protection Bureau Laser Testing Laboratory. Prior to initiating this project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of handheld portable laser pointer sellers in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2018-2019 fiscal year, laser testing of 24 different products was carried out. The testing resulted in 3 stop sales to address non-compliance and 21 instances where no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
