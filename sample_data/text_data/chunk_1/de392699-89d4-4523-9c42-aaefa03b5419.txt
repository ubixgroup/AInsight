IMPACT OF FEDERAL MANDATES ON MENTAL HEALTH
• Throughout the pandemic, our Government has strived to minimize serious illness and death
due to COVID-19, while supporting the mentalhealthand wellness of all Canadians.
• In the fall of 2021, federal vaccine mandates were implemented, including for federal public
servants. At the time, the epidemiological situation was graver than that faced today. Vaccination rates
were lower, whilecase counts were rapidly accelerating from the Delta variant, and increased hospital
and ICU admissions from patients not fully vaccinated were causing strain on the healthcare system.
• In order to provide broader societal protection and to play a leadership role in protecting the
health and safety of our workplaces, our communities, and all Canadians, we introduced mandatory
vaccination for federal public servants. In doing so, we followed public health experts’ guidance and
advice, informed by the latest scientific evidence available on the effectiveness, availability, and uptake
of vaccines.
• We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic, and the necessary public health measures taken to
stall its spread, has had negative impacts on the mental health and wellbeing of all Canadians. That is
why our Government has made significant investments to support those especially impacted.
• Through more supports for mental health and wellbeing, and through public health measures
that promote Canada’s recovery from COVID, our country will be able to move forward.
IF PRESSEDON VACCINE MANDATES IN GENERAL
• In the fall of 2021, federal vaccine mandates were implemented for federally regulated air, rail,
and marine transportation sectors to pursue key objectives, including:
o To ensure the safety and security of the transportation system, passengers and transportation
employees, and the public, delivering protection from infection and severity of illness in workplaces and
for travellers
o To increase up-take to providebroader societal protection; and
o To play a leadership role in protecting the health and safety of our workplaces, our
communities, and all Canadians.
• When vaccine mandates were introduced, two doses of mRNA vaccine provided 80 to 90%
effectiveness against the COVID variants that were circulating at that time. Specifically, the vaccines
protected against the Delta variant, and they helped protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and
death from COVID-19. Based on the circulating variants at the time, vaccination supported the
possibility of achieving high and relatively durable immunity.
• In addition, the epidemiological situation was different. At the time, the number of COVID-19
cases caused by the Delta variant was rapidly accelerating. This was reflected in the increase in cases
with severe illness and was most notable among those who were unvaccinated. Regional trends showed
that hospital and ICU occupancy were increasing, putting more strain on an already strained health care
system, and themajority of hospitalized and ICU patients were not fully vaccinated.
• Overall, vaccination rates were lower when federal vaccine-related requirements and
restrictions were introduced. At the time, there was also strong scientific evidence from international
and domestic sources to conclude that vaccines were very effective at preventing infection.
• The long-range forecast modelling showed strong resurgence such that increased vaccine
uptake and strengthened public health measures were required to reducespread and to slow
acceleration.
• Canada’s measures have been and will continue to be based on review, analysis and expert
opinion, and science. We will continue to take into account the evolving scientific evidence related to
the virus and its characteristics, as well as its epidemiology. We will also consider emerging variants of
concern, the value and impact of public health interventions, and the impact of vaccination and vaccine
effectiveness as we move forward.
IF PRESSED ON MENTAL HEALTH INVESTMENTS FOR THOSE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY
COVID-19
• The Public Health Agency of Canada is investing $100 million over three years to promote
mental health and prevent mental illness in populations most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
These funds willsupport programs that reach youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit, Métis, Black and other
racialized populations, and front line and essential workers whose mental health has been affected.
• The Public Health Agency of Canada is also investing $50 millionover two years to prevent PTSD
and trauma in health care workers, first responders and other service providers who have been
disproportionately affected.
• Projects funded through these investments are beginning in Spring 2022 and will include diverse
interventions, training and capacity building for service providers, and evaluation to learn about
effective approaches to mental health promotion and mental illness prevention in the pandemic
context.
BACKGROUND
Funding for Rapid Tests
In support of the federal vaccination mandate, as well as voluntary testing of front-linepublic servants
at organizations including Correctional Service Canada, Health Canadahas also provided over 5.8M rapid
tests to federaldepartments, agencies and Crowncorporations, asof May 24, 2022.
Proof of vaccination requirements (in general)
Proof of vaccination credentials have been used to support the implementation of vaccination
mandates, which aim to protect those that visit public settings and to control the transmission of COVID-
19. Scientific evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective at preventing hospitalization
and death, and also effective at preventing severe infection. Many provinces and territories have begun
eliminating certain vaccination requirements within their jurisdictions. As of May 20, 2022, all provinces
and territories that had broad vaccination requirements have since rolled them back. Some provinces
and territories have retained vaccination requirements in specific settings (e.g., long term care homes)
and others are giving businesses the option to continue asking for proof of vaccination at their
discretion. To date, all jurisdictions are continuing to issue the Canadian PVC and SK, MB, QC, NB, NU,
NL, NT, and YT have explicitly indicated they will continue to issue and maintain proof of vaccination
credentials for use by residents as needed (e.g. for travel).
Key international partners continue to require proof of vaccination to enter the country and/or access
certain facilities, including G7 countries with one exception: the United Kingdom lifted allremaining
COVID-19 travel measures on March 18, 2022.
Budget 2022 proposes $18 million in 2022-23for the Public Health Agency ofCanada to continue to
work with provincialand territorial governments and withinternational partners to ensure that the
Canadianproof of vaccination credentialremains valid, secure, and accessible to all Canadians.
All provinces and territories that had implemented widespread vaccinationrequirements within their
jurisdictionshave since removed them, thoughrequirements remain in place in some high-risk settings.
To date, all jurisdictionsare continuing to issue the Canadian proof ofvaccination credential. Federal
vaccination requirements (i.e., for domestic air andrail travel, for Government ofCanada employees,
and atCanadian borders) remain in place. Most foreigncountries also continue to require proof of
vaccination for entry by foreigntravellers.
MAIDAND MENTAL ILLNESS
• Our government is aware of the concerns expressed by some aboutthe safe delivery of MAID in
this country.
• We have just tabled the final report of the Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness. This report
focuses on the concerns that arise in cases where a mental illness is the sole underlying condition of a
person requesting MAID.
• Notably, the Panel does not call for more changes to the legislative framework, but instead
indicates the current system of safeguards, when interpreted and applied as the Panel recommends,
provides sufficient protections for vulnerable individuals.
• Our government, as well as the medical community and others who are concerned about safe
and compassionate access to MAID, will carefully review this report. We thank the Expert Panel
members for their time and expertise.
IF PRESSED ON MAIDAND MENTAL ILLNESS (101 words)
• We will listen to the experts, including those at the front lines of our health care system, respect
fundamental freedoms of individuals to make their own life choices, and put the safety and security of
our mostvulnerable people at the forefront of our actions.
• We cannot comment on individual cases, nor should we as only the individuals and their
clinicians involved in these cases truly know the full circumstances.
• We have every confidence in the very dedicated and compassionate MAID assessors in Canada
to make decisions that fully comply with the law and the wishes of individuals who request MAID.
BACKGROUND
An Act to amend the Criminal Code (medical assistance in dying) received Royal Assent on March 17,
2021.
The new MAID legislation:
• removes the requirement for a person’s natural death to be reasonably foreseeable in order to
be eligible for MAID;
• introduces a two-track approach to procedural safeguards based on whether or not a person’s
natural death is reasonably foreseeable;
o existing safeguards are maintained and, in some cases, eased for eligible persons whose natural
death is reasonably foreseeable;
o new and strengthened safeguards are introduced for eligible persons whose natural deathis not
reasonably foreseeable.
• temporarily excludes eligibility for individuals suffering solely from mental illness for 24 months,
and requires the Ministers of Justice and Health to initiate an expert review tasked with making
recommendations within the next year on protocols, guidance and safeguards for MAID for persons
suffering from mental illness;
• allows eligible persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, and who have a set date
to receive MAID, to waive final consent if they are at risk oflosing capacity in the interim;
• requires expanded data collection and analysis through the federal monitoring regime to
provide a more complete and inclusive picture of MAID in Canada.
PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW OF MAID LEGISLATION
The new legislation also required that a Parliamentary Review be undertaken to address (but not
necessarily be limited to) the topics of mature minors, advance requests, mental illness, the state of
palliative care in Canada, and the protection of Canadians with disabilities.
Members of the Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying were named in April 2021 in
accordance with the distribution among parties in the House and Senate as stipulated in the Act. The
Committee held three meetings before dissolution. In early April 2022, the Committee was
reconstituted and resumed its review. The Committee is expected to provide an interim update on its
work on MAID and mental illness in June 2022, and submit its final report and recommendations in the
fall of 2022.
MENTAL ILLNESS: SUNSET CLAUSE AND INDEPENDENT REVIEW
The new legislation included a 24-month sunset clause on the exclusion of MAID requests from
individuals where mental illness is the sole underlying condition. The exclusion clause in thelegislation
sunsets in mid-March 2023, after which time individuals with a mental illness as their sole condition will
be able to request and receive MAID, providing they meet all other eligibility criteria including those that
define a grievous and irremediable medical condition.
The sunset clause is accompanied by a legislative requirement that an independent review be initiated
to consider protocols, guidance and safeguards to apply to MAID requests by persons who have a
mental illness as their sole condition. The legislation stipulates that a report containing the conclusions
and recommendations of the Expert Panel be provided to Ministers and tabled in Parliament.
The Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness was launched in August 2021 to undertake thiswork. It
includes experts from a range of disciplines and perspectives, including clinical psychiatry, MAID
assessment and provision, law, ethics, health professional training and regulation, mental health care
services, as well as lived experience with mental illness.
The Expert Panel’s final report was tabled in Parliament on May 13, 2022. The report makes 19
recommendations for establishing a MAID regime that addresses situations regarding incurability,
irreversibility, individual capacity, suicidalityand the effect of structural vulnerabilities (structural
vulnerabilities being the effects of interactions between a person’s sex, gender, socioeconomic status,
race/ethnicity, sexuality, or institutional location, with one’s position in society). The recommendations
address these concerns in a manner that respects individual autonomy while at the same time
supporting safety and equity.
The Expert Panel also concluded that many of these concerns are neither unique to requests for MAID
from persons with amental disorder, nor applicable to every requestor who has a mental disorder. In
the view of the Expert Panel, their recommendations should apply to any case where similar concerns
may arise, regardless of the requester’s diagnosis. However, in keeping with their mandate, the Expert
Panel did pay particular attention to the concerns in the context of mental disorders.
While some of the Expert Panel’s recommendations are directed at federal, provincial and territorial
governments, the Panel believes that thecurrent framework for MAID found in Canada’s Criminal Code
is sufficient and that further legislative amendments are not required.
The Government is reviewing these recommendations as it shapes future direction in this area. The
report will be forwarded to Parliament’s Special Joint Committee on MAID. The work of the Expert Panel
will assist the Committee as it continues its hearings and deliberations in the lead up to its own interim
report and recommendations on MAID and mental illness later in June 2022.
MAID STATISTICS AND MONITORING REGIME
Under MAID legislation, the federal Minister of Health is obligated to develop regulations for the
collection of data and annual public reporting on MAID in Canada. The first report was released in July
2020. The second annual report was released in July 2021 summarizing data collected for the 2020
calendar year.
The second annual report indicates that, in 2020, there were 7,595 reported cases of MAID, accounting
for 2.5% of all deaths (this percentage is in the median relative to other permissive jurisdictions). This
represents an increase of 34.2% over 2019 when there were 5,631 reported cases of MAID. All provinces
have experienced a steady year over year growth in the number of MAID cases since 2016. When all
data sources are considered, the total number of medically assisted deaths reported in Canada from the
enactment of federal legislation in 2016 to December 31, 2020 was 21,589.
Though not yet published, Health Canada provided preliminary data for 2021 and anecdotal sources for
a meeting of the Special Joint Committee on MAID, which indicate the following:
• The number of MAID cases continues to increase (approaching 10,000 in 2021)-approximately
a 30% increase from 2020 (7,595);
• Around 2%, or just over 200cases, involved persons whose natural deaths were not reasonably
foreseeable; and,
• As expected, these individuals were slightly younger than the average MAID recipient was and
their predominant medical conditions was much more likely to be neurologicalin nature such as,
Parkinson’s and MS, or chronic pain.
CANADA MENTAL HEALTH TRANSFER
• The government is committed to supporting the mental health needs of Canadians. This
commitment is reflected in a suite of existing, pandemic-responseresponse and new initiatives.
• With my appointment as the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, I am committed to
ensuring that mental health is treated as a full and equal part of the universal healthcare system. A key
way to achieve this objective will be through the establishment of a CanadaMental Health Transfer
(CMHT).
• Budget 2022 reaffirmed the intention of engaging provinces and territories on the development
of a CMHT, which would provide a permanent and ongoing source of funding for mental health services.
• This builds on investments made through Budget 2017 that provided $5 billion over ten years to
provinces and territories to improve access to mental health services.
• Our Government is committed to hearing from all Canadians, including those with lived
experiences, and engaging with communities as part of defining a path forward.
BACKGROUND
The mental health needs of Canadians and priority populations (e.g., youth, Indigenous populations,
racialized and LGBTQ2S+ communities),which were increasing pre-pandemic, have been further
exacerbated by the pandemic. Moreover, persistent barriers to care remain and have worsened during
this time. Some of these barriers include variability in service availability, fragmented care (i.e.,lack of
integration between mental health care/primarycare/other services), lack of equitable access to care,
including virtual care options, lack of culturallysensitive/appropriate services, lack of capacity and
stigma.
These barriers have put increased strain on the healthcare system (e.g., increase in number of
individuals in mental health crisis going to Emergency Departments for care). The pandemic is not yet
over and experts predict that its impact will be felt for many years, if not decades to come.
Ongoing and pandemic-response measures while generally effective are not sufficient to address the
increased demand and barriers. More support is needed to ensure that the mental health needs of
Canadians are addressed while the strain on the health care system is lessened. Given this the
government appointed the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. She is working to ensure that
mental health is treated as a full and equal part of the universal healthcare system and that health
equities areunderstood and addressed.
Ongoing Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments madein the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government has allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadians can access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) MentalHealth Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
$9 million is being provided to the United Way (through New Horizons) for practical services for seniors.
The Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health ofBlack Canadians Fund is investing $10 million to support
community-based projects across Canada.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surgein demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding will support the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association and Crisis Services Canada. By 2023,
this service will provide people across Canada with accessto 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from
trained responders, using the technology of their choice (voice, text or chat). The Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focused on raising public awareness, reducing
stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and evidence-based
practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned
for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the Government of Canada
to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously supported by
parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan that aligns
with the Framework.
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Pursuant to the Federal Framework on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act, Canada’s first Federal
Framework on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was tabled in Parliament on January 22, 2020 and
made public on February 13, 2020. To informthe development of the Framework, in accordance with
the Act, the Minister of Health convened a National Conference on PTSD in April 2019 with the Ministers
of National Defence, Veterans Affairs, and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, partners and
stakeholders, including people with lived-experience. The Government of Canada is now working with
partners on the implementation of the Framework. The Act requires the Public Health Agency of Canada
to report on the effectiveness of the Framework within five years of its release (by February 2025).
Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services and Address the
Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians’ Mental Health
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada invested $130 million from2020-22 in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal, and received $140 million in Budget 2022 to support the portal
for two more years beginning in 2022-23. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist with finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national serviceoffering support to young people via
phone, text and live chat, and is a global leader in developing and delivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mentalhealth, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including health care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and
Métis, and Black and other racialized Canadians.
• $50 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects to address posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in frontline workers andothers who are most affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence
Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $333
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects
led by experts across the country.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative currently supports 101 research projects, representing a total
investment of $13.5 million from CIHR and partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel
composed of leading Canadian experts in mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated
through these projects will be mobilized to ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
CIHR provided the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse with a $1 million directed grant to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providers in light
of COVID-19. This includes the creation of six national guidance documents and a rapid assessment of
the challenges faced by people who use drugs during the COVID-19 crisis to guide future policy
decisions.
Statistics Canada developed and administersa web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. In addition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cyclesof
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health to better understand the wider impacts of the
pandemic on mental health in Canada. A special collection of research articles based on the first cycle of
data was released in the Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention Journal on September 27,
2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also resumed in September 2020. The Canadian
Community Health Survey provides data on a variety of mental health indicators, and has been collected
for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for ongoing measurement of changes in mental
health of the Canadian population as the pandemic continues and as Canada recovers.
HC’s 2020-21 Departmental Results Report
Health Canada advanced the development of national standards for access to mental health services to
gain insight on practical approaches to developing and implementing these standards. As part of this
work, Health Canada has entered into an agreement with the Standards Council of Canada to lead the
development of standards in the following priority areas, in alignment with the Common Statement of
Principles on Shared Health Priorities developed by federal, provincial and territorial governments:
• Children andyouth:
o Integrated Youth Services: increase access to youth mental health and substance use supports
that are integrated with physical health, sexual health and social services
• Primary Health Services Integration:
o Primary Care Integration: increase access to quality, integrated mental healthand substance use
supports in primary care settings
o Digital Mental Health and Substance Use Apps: improve access to high-quality, safe and
effective apps to help Canadians make better-informed app choices
• People with complex needs:
o Substance Use Treatment Centres: improve access to high-quality, evidence-based care and
promote an integrated and coordinated treatment system
o Substances Use Workforce: increase substance use workforce capacity to provide evidence-
based care and stepped-care approaches
o Integrated Services for Complex Health Needs: improve integrated treatment approaches for
individuals with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders and complex health needs
HEALTH FUNDING AGREEMENTS AND TRANSFERS
• The pandemic has highlighted the need for resilient health care systems in Canada. That is why
our government is committed to working collaboratively with provinces and territories to provide
pandemic supports and to strengthen Medicare.
• Our Government will continue to work closely with provinces and territories in order to improve
health care and health outcomes for Canadians across the country.
IF PRESSED (GENERAL,including amounts)
• From the beginning, the Government of Canada has been there to support provinces and
territories in the fight against COVID-19. More than eight of every ten dollars spent to fight COVID-19
and support Canadians comes from the federal government.
• In 2020-21, the Government of Canada provided $41.9 billion in cash support to provinces and
territories through the Canada Health Transfer (CHT), growing to $43.1 billion in 2021-22 and $45.2
billion in 2022-23. This stable, predictable funding is in addition to another $19.1 billion in pandemic
support for provincial and territorial health care systems in 2020-21 (e.g. $4 B to help address health
system pressures and $1 billion to support immunization campaigns).
• In addition to funding directly to provinces and territories, the federal government made $19
billion in direct health investments in 2020-21 to support the fight against COVID, including public health
support and thepurchase of vaccines and tests.
• Between 2019 and 2027, the federal government estimates that federal health related COVID-
19 spending will total $72.4 billion. This includes a total of $23.2 billon in transfer to provinces and
territories and $49.2 billion in direct federal spending (e.g., spending on PPE, vaccines, and rapid tests).
• This does not include our continued collaboration with provincesand territories on shared
priorities, supported by targeted federal investments of:
o $11 billion over 10 years for provinces and territories to improve access to home and
community care and mental health and addiction services; and
o More recently, $4 billion to help provinces and territories improve infection prevention and
control and the standard of care in their long-term care facilities.
IF PRESSED ON BILL C-237 (BQ PMB INTRODUCED BY MR. PLAMONDON (BÉCANCOUR–NICOLET–
SAUREL)
• The government of Canada is committed to protecting our publicly funded health care system
and supporting provinces and territories in the delivery of care to their residents. The Canada Health
Transfer (CHT) remains the key federal funding mechanism for supporting Canada’s health care system,
providing long-term, predictable fundingto provinces and territories.
• The Canada Health Act (CHA) establishes principles that provinces and territories must fulfill in
order to receive their full Canada Health Transfer (CHT) cash contribution. The five principles of the CHA
are designed to ensure that all Canadians, regardless of which province or territory they reside in or
travel to, have universal access to comprehensive, publicly administered care. Beyond the link to these
basic principles, the CHT is unconditional and gives provinces and territories the autonomy to decide
how best to allocate these funds in order to address the health care needs of their residents and
communities.
• However, our system is in need of improvement. Past experience tells us that improvements will
not be easily achieved by merely adding more federal money. Canada is among the world’s top tier of
spenders on health care and yet we are not achieving the kind of results that Canadians need. Canadians
expect new funds to be invested in a way that achieves tangible improvements in health care. The
federal government understands that targeted investments are needed to accelerate change and
improve the responsiveness and sustainability of the health system.
IFPRESSED ON THE CANADA MENTAL HEALTH TRANSFER–PLATFORM COMMITMENT
• The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring Canadians have access to mental health
and substance use supports when and where they need them. That is why it is so important to assist
jurisdictions to expand the delivery of high-quality and accessible mental health and substance use
services.
• The Government of Canada has already made significant investments in this area, including $5B
to support mental health and substance use services through its bilateral agreements with provinces
and territories. The Government of Canada is committed to make significant additional investments,
with accountability and data to demonstrate results for Canadians. We want to ensure that Canadians
getthe services and supports they need and that our investments have a positive impact on their mental
health.
IF PRESSED ON QUEBEC
• Our Government is committed to ensuring it is there to meet the needs of the people of
Quebec, and continues to work with all provinces and territories to strengthen public health care.
• The Canada-Quebec home and community care and mental health and addiction services
bilateral agreement will flow approximately $2.5 billion over 10 years in funds targeted to support home
andcommunity care and mental health and addiction services and reflects the principles of
asymmetrical federalism as recognized in 2004.
• Our government also committed to new targeted funds for Quebec and other provinces and
territories for virtual care, safe long-term care and support through theSafe Restart agreement.
• This is in addition to the Canada Health Transfer, which will flow over $10.1 billion to Quebec in
2022-23.
• Quebec will also receive $450 million and $902.4 million as part of its shareof the $2 and $4
billion, one-time top-ups to the CHT. It will also receive a further $225.6 million to support COVID-19
immunizations.
IF PRESSED NEXT STEPS FOR BILATERAL AGREEMENTS
• The Government of Canada signed home and community care and mental health and addiction
services bilateral agreements with all provinces and territories to flow $5 billion in targeted funding for
home care and mental health from 2017-18 through 2021-22.
• We are now working with provinces and territories to amend those agreements to flow funding
for the $1 billion Safe Long-term Care Fund.
• A new round of bilateral agreements will be negotiated to flow the remaining $6 billion in
funding starting in 2022-23, and these agreements will also flow Budget 2021 commitment of $3billion
over five years to ensure that standards for long-term care are upheld across the country and that
seniors are guaranteed the care they deserve, no matter where they live.
BACKGROUND
Council of the Federation (CoF) Request for Increased in(CHT)
In September 2020, the Council of the Federation (CoF) made a formal request for an increase in health
transfers to help address the PT projected increase in health care costs associated with COVID-19 and
pressures such as an aging population, and new drugs/technology. The increase requested by CoF would
have had the CHT rise to $70 billion, an increase of $28 billion from $42 billion in 2020-21, or from its
current 23% share of PT health spending to 35%. CoF has also called for the CHT to grow by anannual
escalator of at least 5% (March 4, 2021), and reiterated this demand in December 2021.
In July 2021, the Government provided provinces and territories with an additional $5 billion for health
care, including a $4 billion, one-time top-up to the CHT intended to support PTs to clear the backlog of
procedures caused by waves one and two of the pandemic. Bill C-25 also provides PTs with $1 billion to
support Canada’s COVID-19 immunization plan. Additionally, the Bill provides $2.2 billion to address
infrastructure priorities. The $4 billion CHT top-up is in addition to the COVID-19 Response Fund that
also provided one-time funding of $500 million through the CHT in 2019-20 to support PTs’ critical
health care system needs and COVID-19 mitigation efforts.
The Canada Health Transfer (CHT), the largest major transfer to PTs, provides long-term predictable
funding for health care, and is tied to PTs’ respect for the principles of the Canada Health Act, which are:
universality; comprehensiveness; portability; accessibility; and, public administration. In 2021-2022, PTs
will receive $43.1 billion through the CHT, growing to $45.2 billion in 2022-23.
BILL C-237-An Act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act and the Canada Health Act
This BQPrivate Member's Bill was introduced by Mr. Plamondon (Bécancour—Nicolet—Saurel) on 7
February 2022. It was also tabled in the previous parliamentary session (43-2) but did not proceed past
First Reading on 27 May 2021. The Bill seeks to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act in
order to allow a province with a program whose objectives are comparable to those of a federal
program in an area under provincial legislative authority (e.g., health care) to withdraw from the federal
program, with full compensation.
The Bill also seeks to amend the Canada Health Act in order to exempt Quebec (and other provinces)
from the national criteria and conditions that are required for a province to receive its full allocation of
the Canada Health Transfer. The Bill would also exempt Quebec from other federal standards including
planned long-term care standards.
Pandemic Funding:
In 2020-21, the federal government provided $19.1 billion, beyond the Canada Health Transfer, in
pandemic support for provincial and territorial health care systems in 2020-21 to support the fight
against COVID, including public health support and the purchase of vaccines and tests and other funding
(e.g. $4 B to help address health system pressures and $1 billion to support immunization campaigns).
As part of its new mandate, the government has committed to providing additional pandemic support
including for immunization and therapeutics, as well as, support for primary care, virtual care, long-term
care, palliative care, mental health, and problematic substance use.
Between 2019 and 2027, the federal government estimates that federal health related COVID-19
spending will total $76.7 billion. This includes a total of $25.6 billon in transfer to provinces and
territories and $51.1 billion in direct federal spending (e.g., spending on PPE, vaccines, and rapid tests).
Federal Targeted Funding:
On March 22, 2017, Budget 2017 committed to $11 billion over 10 years to improve access to home care
and mental health services.
Shared HealthPriorities and Bilateral Agreements:
In August 2017, all PTs (except Quebec) agreed to a Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health
Priorities, which sets out priorities for action in home and community care, and mental health and
addiction services.On March 10, 2017, the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec
agreed to an asymmetrical arrangement distinct from this Common Statement of Principles and based
on the asymmetrical agreements of September 2004.
The Common Statement also includes a commitment for PT governments to work with the Canadian
Institute for Health Information on a set of common indicators in these areas, to continue collaborating
to advance work in health innovation and prescription drugs, and to engage with Indigenousleaders to
improve health outcomes for Indigenous peoples. At the June 2018 Health Ministers’ meeting, Health
Ministers (except Quebec) endorsed a set of common indicators, developed by CIHI and FPT
governments, to measure and report progress to Canadianson shared priorities.
Recognizing the unique circumstances in Nunavut, and to provide Nunavut the flexibility it required to
implement initiatives that will improve access to home and community care and mental health and
addiction services, it was agreedthat the start date of the agreement would be delayed by a year, i.e.,
beginning 2019-20.
The funding is allocated to PTs on a per capita basis.
Renewal of Agreements:
The first year of funding (2017-18) flowed to PTs based on their acceptance of thefederal funding offer,
as outlined in the Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1. The Government of Canada then engaged
with PTs to negotiate detailed funding agreements for the 2018-19 to 2021-22 period. The Government
of Canada will negotiate the renewalof these agreements in 2021-22 for the remaining five years (2022-
23 to 2026-27). Bilateral agreements with all provinces and territories have been signed and are posted
online.
Safe Long-term Care:
The 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a commitment of up to $1 billion for a Safe Long-term
Care Fund, to help provinces and territories protect people in long-term care and support infection
prevention and control. Funding will be contingent on a detailed spending plan, and conditional on
provinces andterritories demonstrating that investments have been made according to those spending
plans. Provinces and territories will be able to use this funding to undertake a range of activities,
including carrying out infection prevention and control readiness assessments, making improvements to
ventilation and hiring additional staff or topping up wages.
Long-term Care Standards:
Budget 2021 proposed to provide $3B over five years to Health Canada to support provinces and
territories in ensuring standards for long-term care are applied and permanent changes are made. The
federal government will work collaboratively with provinces and territories, while respecting their
jurisdiction over health care, including long-term care. This work would ensure seniors and those in care
live in safe and dignified conditions.
The pandemic has shone a light on systemic issues affecting long-term care facilities across the country.
The government welcomes the news that the Health Standards Organization and Canadian Standards
Association are launching a process to help address those issues in Canada. The Health Standards
Organization’s and Canadian Standards Association’s work with governments, stakeholders, and
Canadians to develop national standards will help inform our ongoingdiscussions with provinces and
territories on improving the quality of life of seniors in long-term care.
Virtual Care:
In May 2020, the Prime Minister announced $240.5M to support virtual care and digital tools for
Canadians. This funding will support the rapid roll out of virtual care and needed supports for health
systems, as the Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories to assist health services
to undertake virtual care and provide health services at a distance. Of this funding,$150M will flow to
PTs through bilateral agreements for enhancements to virtual services focused on secure messaging and
file transfer, secure videoconferencing, remote patient monitoring, patient online access to test results,
and back-end supports to integrate these tools within existing digital systems.
In addition, Canada Health Infoway will receive up to $50M to develop pan-Canadian standards on
secure messaging and videoconferencing and support PTs as they implement new initiatives pursuant to
the bilateral agreements.

SUICIDE PREVENTION
• The Government of Canada recognizes the importance for all Canadians to have access to
critical mental healthresources and suicide prevention services.
• Budget 2019 announced $25 million over five years, starting in 2019 20, with $5 million per year
ongoing, to develop and sustain a pan-Canadian suicide prevention service, in order to provide people
across Canada with access to bilingual, 24/7 crisis support from trained responders using the technology
of their choice: voice, text or chat.
• The Canada Suicide Prevention Service (1-833-456-4566) currently makes suicide crisis support
available over the phone inEnglish and French to anyone in Canada, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Support is available in English by texting 45645 from 4pmto midnight, Eastern Time.
• The Government of Canada also supports the implementation of a three-digit number for
suicide prevention that is easier to remember and improves access to crisis support. We are working to
ensure that this service will have the capacity to route callers appropriately and connect people to the
crisis support they need, once it is launched.
IF PRESSED ON COVID-19 MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SUPPORTS
• The Government is providing over $14.8 million over 36 months to Kids Help Phone to provide
crisis supports for childrenand youth during the pandemic.
• In addition to investments in suicide crisis services, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement
announced a $50 million investment to bolster the capacity of distress centres across the country, which
are experiencing a surge in demand for crisis support during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• This includes two new investments announced in April 2022: $2.0 million to the Centre for
Addiction and Mental Health to support resources for distress centres, and $1.8 million towards13
distress centres in Canada.
• PHAC is also providing additional funding for the Canada Suicide Prevention Service to support
the increased demand for crisis support at this time.
BACKGROUND
Suicide is a significant public health issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds across Canada.
The Canada Suicide Prevention Service currentlyprovides people across Canada with suicide crisis
support from trained responders via phone, in English and French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Between 2017 and 2019, there were approximately 4,500 deaths by suicide per year in Canada, which is
equivalent to 12 people dying by suicide every day. In 2019, suicide was the 9th leading cause of death
among all Canadians, and the 2nd leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 34, behind
unintentional injuries. According to preliminary data, there were 3,839 deaths by suicide reported in
2020. The 2020 data is provisional and incomplete, and could potentially increase by 5 to 15% over the
next year. This delay is due to the length of time that coroners and medical examiners sometimes
require to complete their investigations. At this time, caution should be used to arrive at any conclusions
regarding suicide trends during the pandemic (Statistics Canada). There is no single cause that fully
explains or predicts suicide; a combination of factors areassociated with suicide, such as mental illness,
physical health, personal issues and loss, childhood abuse and neglect, and exposure to trauma.
COVID-19 Mental Health Crisis Supports: Through the 2020 Fall Economic Statement, the Government of
Canada announced a $50 million investment to bolster the capacity of distress centres. PHAC is
administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021-22 and grants to 13
distress centres in 2022-23 following a second solicitation reaching organizations not included in the first
round of funding. In addition, $2 million of this funding is supporting CAMH as it curates resources to
assist distress centres in meeting the needs of priority populations.
Motion 174–A National Suicide Prevention Action Plan: In April 2018, MP Charlie Angus (NDP, Timmins-
James Bay) sponsored motion M-174, calling for the Government to establish a national suicide
prevention action plan. On May 8, 2019, parliamentarians voted unanimously in favour of M-174,
though it is non-binding. The proposed actions in the plan are aligned with the Framework. PHAC will
facilitate coordination and collaboration on elements of the action plan with relevant departments,
agencies and key stakeholders through its convening roleon the Framework. An update on M-174 was
included in the December 2020 Progress Report on the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention.
Efforts to develop the Action Plan will be included in the December 2022 Progress Report as part of
legislated reportingof the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention.
Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health and Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events: PHAC is
currently conducting surveillance to understand the impact of COVID-19 on suicide and mental health.
The Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health showed that during the pandemic, 2.4% of adults in Canada
reported suicidal ideation since the pandemic began in 2020, which is not significantly different from the
2.7% before the pandemic in 2019; but the percentage increased significantly in spring 2021 to 4.2%.
Risk factors of reporting suicide ideation during the pandemic included being under 65, Canadian-born, a
frontline worker, reporting pandemic-related income/job loss or loneliness/isolation, experiencing a
highly stressful/traumatic event during one's lifetime, and having lower household income and
educational attainment. Continued surveillance of suicide and risk/protective factors is needed to
inform suicide prevention efforts.
3-DIGIT SUICIDE PREVENTION LINE
Key Messages
• In 2021, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission launched a
regulatory proceeding to consult on a proposed three-digit hotline so Canadians have a memorable
number they can call when they are having an acutesuicide crisis. The CRTC is now doing their internal
analysis to inform their decisions.
• The Government of Canada continues to be very supportive of these efforts including ensuring
funds are available to support the creation of this hotline.
• We needto ensure that this service will have the capacity to answer those calls and route them
appropriately, connecting people tothe crisis support they need.
• The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring that everyone in Canada will have access
to these services, regardless of their location.
• Canadians currently have access to the Canada Suicide Prevention Service, which provides
people across Canada with suicide crisis support from trained responders via phone (1-833-456-4566), in
English and French,24 hours a day, seven days a week.
• Budget 2022 announced $140 million over two years to Health Canada to continue providing
virtual mental health and substance use supports via the Wellness Together Canada portal.
• Indigenous Services Canada is also supporting the Hope for Wellness Helpline, which provides
immediate and culturally safe crisis support for First Nations and Inuit, 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, by phone (1-855-242-3310) or online chat. This service is available in English and French,and
upon request in Cree, Ojibway, and Inuktitut.
IF PRESSED ON TIMING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A THREE-DIGIT NUMBER FOR SUICIDE
PREVENTION CRISIS SUPPORT
• The CRTC has completed its regulatory study and is now doing their own analysis to informtheir
decisions later in 2022.
• In the meantime, our work continues. We are engaging with a range of stakeholders for their
perspectives on what a successful roll-out will looklike and what it will require.
• The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) hascontracted a firm to do an analysis on what
service volumes associated with launching a three-digit number could look like. We need this analysis to
help identify the resources required.
• PHAC is also meeting with organizations in the crisis line sectorto understand key requirements
for a successful rollout. This is expected to build on the progress of the pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service.
• When I visited the Klinic Crisis Program in Winnipeg, I spoke with the folks answering those calls
and theywere clear that they need more resources. This is what we are working on as we await the
recommendations from the CRTC; to ensure that we have enough resources to ‘get it right’.
• Officials are meeting with provincial and territorial suicide and mentalhealth leads, as well as
Indigenous organisations, to understand the systems they have already put in place to ensure we do not
duplicate their work.
• I also understand that the CRTC is analyzing the telecommunication and technical infrastructure
requirements, which are critical aspects to success inlaunching a three-digit number.
• Following the CRTC’s decision, telecommunication service providers will need to take steps for
988 to function. This includes:
o Transitioning certain regionsto ten-digit local dialing; and
o Making modifications to their networks to implement the three-digit number.
• During the CRTC public consultations, telecommunication service providers indicated they will
need a total of up to 15months to complete this work.
• That includes up to 9 months to transition to ten-digit dialing; and up to an additional 6 months
to modify networks to accept 988 as a three digit number.
• The reason it’s important to transition areas from seven to ten-digit local dialing is because
some seven-digit numbers start with 988 (e.g., 988-1111). That means that in those areas, if a caller dials
988, their phone will expect another four digits to connect the call.
• The objective is to ensure that everyone in Canada will be able to use the 988 number, and
these important steps will help get us there.
IF PRESSED ON WHY BUDGET 2022 DID NOT ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO SUPPORT A THREE-DIGIT
NUMBER
• Budget 2021 highlighted the Government’s commitment to support a three-digitnumber for
suicide prevention.
• We are looking forward to the CRTC’s decision on this matter, which will help to determine
technology requirements.
• While 3-digit crisis line support is in development, we will continue to support the Canada
Suicide Prevention Service and surge capacityfor distress lines and Kids Help Phone to meet demands
for services.
• As we prepare for the decision and recommendations of the CRTC, crisis support is available to
people in Canada through:
o The Canada Suicide Prevention Service (1-833-456-4566)
o 1-866-APPELLE (277-3553) for people in Quebec
o Hope for Wellness for Indigenous peoples (1-855-242-3310)
o Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868)
o Provincial and local distress lines
o Trans Lifeline (1-877-330-6366)
IF PRESSED ON INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES OFA THREE-DIGIT NUMBER
• In the United States, preparation for a three-digit number took place over a four-year period.
Legislation was introduced in 2018, followed by a public proceeding that ended in 2020, resulting in the
upcoming launch of 988 in theUnited States on July 16, 2022.
• The CRTC is of the preliminary view that 988 should also be the three digit number used for
suicide prevention in Canada.
• The choice to assign 988 in the United States and Canada is due to the unavailability of a three-
digit numberending in 11 (e.g., 411, 911).
• We are working closely with our counterparts in the United States and learning from their best
practices to help guide Canada’s approach to implementing a three-digit number.
• As we learn from the experiences of other countries like the United States, our goal is to be
ready for a safe and seamless rollout so that calls do not go unanswered.
IF PRESSED ON THE CRTC’S STUDY INTO THE CREATION OF A THREE-DIGIT SUICIDE PREVENTION
NUMBER (74 WORDS)
• The Government of Canada is closely following the CRTC regulatory public proceeding on the
introduction of a three-digit suicide prevention number,which closed on March 17, 2022.
• The public proceeding includes submissions from telecommunication services providers,
Indigenous organizations, suicide prevention stakeholders, and Canadians at large, which are considered
in the Commission’s decision to assign a three-digit number. We anticipate that the CRTC will issue a
decision later in 2022.
BACKGROUND
Three-Digit Number for Suicide Prevention
In the Minister of Mental Health and Addiction’s Mandate Letter, the Minister was directed to
implement a three-digit suicide prevention number.
This initiative builds upon the Government’s current support of a pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is currently investing $21 million over 5 years ($4.2
million per year) for the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), with their partners, to
implement and sustain this service. In addition, $800,000 per year is allocated to PHAC to cover the
oversight, administration, reporting and evaluation activities associated with the Contribution
Agreement with CAMH. The Canada Suicide Prevention Service provides people across Canada with
suicide crisis support from trained responders via phone (1-833-456-4566), in English and French, 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Calls to the service are answered by trained responders from a network
of 11 community-based distress centres across Canada and a back-up hub of responders.
On December 11, 2020, parliamentarians voted unanimously in favour of a motion sponsored by MP
Todd Doherty (Conservative, British Columbia) calling on the federal government to act immediately to
set up a national 988number to consolidate all existing suicide crisis numbers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is responsible for
establishing any three digit abbreviated codes. The CRTC launched a regulatory proceeding on June 3,
2021to consult on a proposed three-digit hotline. Following a procedural request from stakeholders
representing persons with disabilities, the CRTC published key portions of the notice of consultation in
sign language and reopened the consultation in November2021 to allow for new interventions in
accessible formats, such as video. The public consultation closed on March 17, 2022. These
interventions and replies form part of the public record that the Commission will examine to make its
determinations.
At thecore of this proceeding is ensuring that a three-digit number is implemented quickly and
correctly, despite the complexity of modifications to telecommunications networks required, to ensure
that every call to this three-digit number is efficiently and appropriately routed. The CRTC intends to
issue a decision on this matter in 2022.
In parallel, PHAC is looking at various service delivery aspects, including by gathering estimates on
expected call volumes and demand, and building on international learnings. For example, the US is
estimating a fourfold to tenfold increase in call volume for their service, which is expected to fully launch
in summer 2022, after over 4 years of preparation. PHAC is also assessing the capacity of potential
service providers to respond to expected increases in call volumes. PHAC will be engaging with
provincial and territorial governments, Indigenous organizations, international governments, and other
stakeholders to inform next steps in relation to service delivery, such as the scope of the service and
coordination with other services.
As highlighted in Budget 2021, the government is committed to ensuring funds are available to support
the creation of this three-digit number.
OPIOID OVERDOSE CRISIS
• OurGovernment recognizes that the overdose crisis is one of the most serious and
unprecedented public health threats in Canada’s history.
• Substance use is a public health issue, not an issue for the criminal justice system.
• The pandemic has highlightedthe gaps that exist in our health system and social safety net.
• We remain committed to a whole-of-society approach to address the opioid overdose crisis to
ensure that Canadians receive the life-saving substance use and health supports they need.
IF PRESSED ON BUDGET 2022 COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID OVERDOSE CRISIS
• The Government of Canada has announced new federal investments through Budget 2022 to
address the overdose crisis. These investments will support harm reduction, treatment and prevention
at the community level.
• Funding from Budget 2022 will provide $100M to expand Health Canada’s Substance Use and
Addictions Program forcommunity-based interventions.
• The Government has committed over $800 million to address the opioid overdosecrisis. We
remain committed to working with all levels of government, direct service providers, and people with
lived and living experience to save lives.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEW NUMBERS DISCLOSEDIN THE OPIOID REPORT
• Our Government remains deeply concerned over the tragic loss of so many lives to the overdose
crisis. The lack of available treatment, safer supply, and other services remain challenging.
• That is why our Government remains committed to addressing the overdose crisis through a
comprehensiveapproach, including naloxone access and training, supervised consumption sites and
safer supply programs. Without these, the number of deaths would be exponentially worse.
• Our Government remains committed to working with all our partners to end this complex public
health crisis.
IFPRESSED ONTREATMENT
• Our Government recognizes that improved access to treatment servicesfor substance use is
critical.
• We have approved the use of new medications for treatment, removed barriers to prescribing
and dispensing, and supported the development of clinical guidelines for injectable opioid agonist
treatment.
• We provided $150 million to provinces and territories to improve access to evidence-based
treatment services.
• In March, our Government announced that,in partnership with the Standards Council of
Canada, we are developing national standards for mental health and substance use.
IF PRESSED ON HARM REDUCTION
• Evidence shows that harm reduction measures work. Our Government will continue to support
life-saving initiatives.
• The Government has funded innovative projects, such as providing medication as an alternative
tothe toxic illegal drug supply.
• Supervised consumption sites save lives. Since 2017, federally authorized supervised
consumption siteshave reversed nearly 35,000 overdoses without a single death at a site.
• We have provided the authority for provinces and territories to establish temporary urgent
public health need sites, otherwise known as overdose prevention sites, to address risingoverdoses.
IF PRESSED ON AWARENESS AND PREVENTION
• Our Government recognizes the importance of investing in prevention and awareness.
• We have invested in prevention campaigns that include engaging youth and young adults on
risks and harms of substanceuse and the impact of stigma on people who use drugs.
• We supported school-based approaches that enhance student well-being in order to prevent
substance use related harmsfor this important population.
• We are also funding projects that promote changes in the health system to help enhance the
pathways to care for people who use drugs.
IF PRESSED ON SAFER SUPPLY
• Our Government understands the pandemic has led to an increasingly dangerous and
unpredictable illegal drug supply.
• We have taken action by funding, through the Substance Use and Addictions Program, projects
that provide people who use drugs with safer, pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to the toxic illegal drug
supply and offer services thatsupport people who use drugs.
• Since 2019, the Government has committed over $63 million in funding for 17 safer supply
projects in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and one national community of
practice.
IF PRESSED ON SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION SITES
• Evidence shows that supervised consumption sites reduce harms and save lives.
• Since 2017, supervised consumption sites in Canada have received more than 3.3 million visits,
reversed almost 35,000 overdoses without a single death at a site, and made over 148,000 referralsto
health and social services.
• These sites also provide access to other health and social services, including opportunities to
access treatment.
• We will continue to work with provinces, territories, and stakeholdersso that Canadians
continue to have access to these lifesaving services.
IF PRESSED ON THE 6-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF BC DECLARING A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY
• Depuis le 14 avril 2022, cela fait six ans que la Colombie-Britannique a déclaré une urgence de
santé publique en raison d'une augmentation significative des surdoseset des décès liés à la drogue.
• À l'occasion de cet anniversaire, nous reconnaissons que cette question complexe continue de
s’aggraver.
• Malgré cela, la Loi sur les mesures d'urgence fédérale n'est pas un mécanisme approprié pour
faire face à la crise actuelle des surdoses d'opioïdes, qui exige un effort à plus long terme, soutenu et
multi-juridictionnel pour faire face aux facteurs sanitaires, sociaux et économiques complexes et
interdépendants qui sont à l'origine des décès et des méfaits liés aux opioïdes.
IF PRESSED ON MOMS STOP THE HARM (MSTH) LITIGATION REGARDING ALBERTA’S RECOVERY
ORIENTED OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES GUIDE (NEW MEASURES FOR SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION
SITES)
• TheGovernment of Canada is committed to a comprehensive public health approach to the
overdose crisis that includes evidence-based harm reduction activities, such as supervisedconsumption
sites and services.
• The evidence is clear-supervised consumption sites reduce harms and save lives. I intend to
continue to engage and work with provinces and territories, as well as municipalities, to enable access
to evidence based services.
• We will continue to follow the litigation closely and consider its impact on federal policy and
legislation.
IF PRESSED ON SUAP FUNDING FOR MOMSSTOP THE HARM (MSTH)
• MSTH recevra 344 935 $ sur 24 mois pour établir un réseau de bénévoles et de pairs animateurs
payés qui ont une expérience concrète de la dépendance. Ce réseau informera les familles au sujet de
services et de ressources fondés sur des données probantes et il les sensibilisera à la réduction des
méfaits en leur expliquant comment protégerleurs proches.
• Il offrira également un soutien émotionnel aux familles ayant perdu des proches à la suite de
surdoses.
IF PRESSED ON THE EXPERT TASK FORCE ON SUBSTANCE USE
• We are committed to a comprehensive public health approach to substance usethat is focused
on reducing harms, saving lives, and gettingpeople the supports they need.
• We are studying the Expert Task Force on Substance Use recommendations on how we can
better treat substance use as a health issue. These recommendations are publicly available on the
Health Canada website.
IF PRESSED ON PAIN
• In May 2021, the Canadian Pain Task Force published their final report with recommendations
to ensure people with pain are recognized and supported, and that pain is understood, prevented,and
effectively treated.
• We have invested over $175M in research through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research
and close to $19M in funding for 12 initiatives through the Substance Use and Addictions Program
(SUAP) focused on improving opioid prescribing practices and pain management.
• We will continue to work with our partners to explore implementing the recommendations.
IF PRESSED ON DIACETYLMORPHINEHYDROCHLORIDE (DAM)
• On February 16, 2022, Health Canada authorized Diacetylmorphine Hydrochloride (DAM) as a
supervised injectable opioid agonist treatment.
• Diacetylmorphine has already been approved in a number of European countries. Evidence
shows that it can help stabilize and improve the health of some people who are living with an addiction,
including increasing their retention in treatment programs.
• As with all authorized drugs, Health Canada will monitor its safety and effectiveness and will
take prompt action should concerns arise.
IF PRESSED ON SUAP FUNDING
• Budget 2022 committed$100 million over three years, to the Substance Use and Addictions
Program (SUAP) to support harm reduction, treatment, and prevention at the community level.
• Through Budget 2021, $116M over two years was provided to SUAP to support a range of
innovativeapproaches. To disperse these funds the department launched a national call for proposals
seeking new efforts to reduce, prevent, and address the harms from substance use. Applicants were
notified of funding decisions and the Department is currently negotiating funding agreements.
IF PRESSED ON HEALTH CANADA REGULATORY ACTIONS
• Pharmaceutical companies have a role to play in addressing the opioid overdose crisis.
• In June 2018, following a call to action by the Government of Canada, numerous pharmaceutical
companies committed to suspending all promotional and advertising activities related to prescription
opioids.
• The Food and Drugs Act was amended to strengthen the penalties for misleading advertising.
The maximum penalty is now up to $5 million peroffence.
• Health Canada has further restricted the marketing and advertising of opioids by imposing
additional Terms and Conditions for prescription opioid-containing products.
BACKGROUND
On April 14, 2016, BC first declared a public health emergencydue to the rise in opioid-related deaths.
Since then, two other PTs have also declared emergencies: Alberta declared a public health crisis in May
2017 and the Yukon declared a substance use health emergency in January 2022.
Most recent national data indicates that 26,690 apparent opioid toxicity deaths occurred between
January 2016 and September 2021. Toxicity of supply continues to be a major driver of the crisis with as
many as 86% of accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths in 2021 (January to September) involving
fentanyl. While Canadians of all walks of life are affected, there are striking patterns, with death most
common among males and individuals aged 20 to 59 years old.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compounding the ongoing overdose crisis, and people who use drugs are
experiencing higher risks related to an increasingly toxic illegal drug supply and reduced access to
treatment and harm reduction services. Several jurisdictions have observed unprecedented numbers
and rates in relation to the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although these increases have been observed across the country, Western Canada continues to be
highly impacted. In 2021, the British Columbia Coroners Service reported 2,232 illegal drug toxicity
deaths, a 26% increase from 2020 and a 127% increase over the number of deaths in 2019. Additionally,
the crisis in BC has continued into 2022 with 548 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths between January
and March 2022, equating to approximately 6 deaths a day in the province. Thisrepresents a slight
increase over the same time period in 2021 (535 deaths).
Data released by Alberta in March 2022 indicated that in 2021 the province reported 1,758 deaths from
all substances, the highest number per year since the province began tracking such deaths in 2016. Of
these deaths, 1,602 were related to opioids. The highest opioid-related death count was in Edmonton
(618) followed by Calgary (498).
Tragically, overdose deaths among First Nations people have also surged. First Nations people in BC died
of an overdose at 4.8 times the rate of other BC residents from January to June of 2021. In Alberta, First
Nations people died of an accidental opioid overdose at seven times the rate of other residents between
January and June of 2020. In Saskatchewan, almost three times as many First Nations females died from
accidental deaths involving opioids than Caucasian females did in 2021.
COLLECTION OF NATIONAL OPIOID-AND STIMULANT-RELATED DATA
The Public Health Agency of Canada publishes quarterly data on opioid-and stimulant-related harms on
behalf of the Special Advisory Committee (SAC) on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses. Data on opioid-
and stimulant-related deaths is provided by Chief Coroners and Chief Medical Examiners. The time
required to complete an investigation into the cause of death for someone suspected of an overdose
can range from approximately three to 24 months.
FEDERAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS
Since 2017, the federal government has taken significant actions and made commitments of over
$800M to address the overdose crisis and substance use-related harms. Additional actions to date
include: improved access to treatment and harm reduction, reduced regulatory barriers to treatment;
strengthened law enforcement, developed of educational products and tools for the public and health
care providers, and research and surveillance to build the evidence base.
This includes Budget 2019 investments of $106.7M over five years with $1M ongoing and $66M
announced in the Fall Economic Statement to help support community-based organizations responding
to substance use issues address the additional challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March
2021, the government announced $20 million in funding for the distribution of naloxone kits and opioid
overdose response training to support communities that have been particularly affected by the opioid
overdose crisis and are experiencing challenges in improving health outcomes of their residents. Budget
2021 also committed an additional $116 million to fund projects through the Substance Use and
Addictions Program (SUAP). A portion of the funds is already being used on the ground. For example,
additional funding has been announced for four safer supply pilot projects in Ontario and British
Columbia. Budget 2022 proposes to provide $100 million over three years, starting in 2022-23 to Health
Canada for the Substance Use and Addictions Program to support harm reduction, treatment, and
prevention at the community level.
In addition to theseinvestments, the Government of Canada has also taken action to make it easier for
people being treated for substance use disorder to access medications and for direct service providers
to establish overdose preventionsites in temporary shelters.
The Minister of Health established an Expert Task Force on Substance Use in March 2021 that provided
expert advice on Canada’s federal drug policy, including examining potential alternatives to criminal
penalties for personal drug possession. The Task Force provided its final advice on alternatives to
criminal penalties in May 2021, and on federal drug policy in June 2021. Both reports of the Task Force
have been made publicly available and can be found online at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-
canada/corporate/about-health-canada/public-engagement/external-advisory-bodies/expert-task-
force-substance-use/reports.html.
USE OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCIES ACT TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID OVERDOSE CRISIS
The Emergencies Act can grant temporary additional and necessary powers to the federal government
when provincial, territorial and federal tools are no longer sufficient to deal effectively with the serious
issues being faced.
There are four types of emergencies that can be declared under the Emergencies Act:
A public welfareemergency;
A public order emergency;
An international emergency; and
A war emergency.
The Emergencies Act includes a suite of stringent, built-in protections that ensure democratic oversight
and accountability with respect to the way in which the Government exercises its powers under the Act.
Given the rigorous criteria that must be met to invoke the Emergencies Act, the Act is intended to serve
as a tool of last resort to ensure the safety and security of Canadians in cases of temporary, critical
nationalemergencies that cannot be addressed with existing laws.
CHALLENGE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA’S RECOVERY ORIENTED OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES
GUIDE
On August 13, 2021, Moms Stop the Harm Society (MSTH) and Lethbridge Overdose Prevention Society
(LOPS)commenced a legal action in the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta against Her Majesty the
Queen in Right of Alberta seeking an Order declaring the provincial Recovery Oriented Overdose
Prevention Services Guide to be constitutionally invalid and inoperable, and of no force and effect on
the basis that it is outside of provincial jurisdiction, and violates Charter rights. Alberta’s Recovery
Oriented Overdose Prevention Services Guide imposes new measures on supervised consumption
services in Alberta, including the creation of a licencing regime for these services and includes an
obligation that supervised consumption service providers ask for a client’s personal health number at
initial intake.
DIACETYLMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDE DRUG AUTHORIZATION
On February 16, 2022, Health Canada authorized Diacetylmorphine Hydrochloride (DAM) as a
supervised injectable opioid agonist treatment (siOAT) for adult patients with severe opioid use disorder
(OUD) who use injectable opioids and have been unsuccessful with previousattempts at opioid agonist
therapy, includingmethadone maintenance therapy.
DAM is available only by prescription. Health care professionals who meet the definition of ‘practitioner’
under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act can prescribe controlledsubstances. Prescribing ability is
further controlled by provincial/territorial scope of practice and any regulatory college requirements for
the prescribing of DAM.
As with any other form of care, a practitioner’s decision to prescribe medications for safer supply
depends on:
• their professional judgement
• the unique needs of each patient
• the rules and regulations in their province or territory
Diacetylmorphine has been approved as a treatment option for severe OUD in a number of countries,
including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Prior to this
authorization, internationally-produced DAM was only available on an emergency basis through the List
of Drugs for an Urgent PublicHealth Need.
At this time, only one company has applied for the authorization of DAM in Canada. Should additional
companies wish to apply for authorization, Health Canada would review their submissions. The company
receiving the authorization, Pharmascience Inc., expects to initially provide DAM supply only for the
province of British Columbia.
The new authorized indication for DAM is as an evidence-based treatment option for severe OUD; this
Health Canada authorization adds a new tool for practitioners to care and prevent harms for people
withsevere opioid disorder, including overdose.
On February 9, 2018, Purdue Pharma in the United States (U.S.) committed to stop marketing opioids to
physicians. This commitment was well-received and a strong example of how the pharmaceutical
industry can support a “re-centering of the pendulum” of prescribing opioids.
In June 2018, the Minister of Health issued a letter to Canadian manufacturers and distributors of
opioids, seeking their commitment to respond to the opioid crisis by immediately ceasing anyand all
marketing and advertising of opioids to health care professionals.
Following the call to action by the Minister of Health, Ginette Petitpas Taylor, Purdue Pharma responded
to the Minister of Health and indicated that as of June 20, 2018 it had “suspended all promotional and
advertising activities relating to our prescription opioids, pending the outcome of your consultation and
the implementation of new regulations.”
LITIGATION AND RELATED CHANGES TO THE FOOD AND DRUGS ACT
US: In 2007, Purdue (US) reached a settlement of $634.5M and acknowledgedmisleading marketing
practices.
Canada: In March 2018, a Saskatchewan judge rejected the proposed $20M Purdue Pharma Canada
class-action settlement, including $2M to provinces. The settlement had previously been approved by
courts in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia.
BC filed a class action lawsuit in August 2018 against approximately 50 Opioid manufacturers and
distributors for allegedly making false or misleading representations onthe effects and consequences of
prescription opioids.
The Government of Canada continues to support and work collaboratively with the provincial and
territorial governments in British Columbia’s proposed legal action against opioid manufacturers and
distributors.
The Government of Canada has not closed the door on taking legal action in Canada against opioid
manufacturers for past inappropriate marketing practices.
The Government of Canada is exploring all appropriate options to hold industry accountable forits role
in the opioid crisis.
While we have not closed the door on pursuing legal action for past wrongdoing, the reality is that the
strong penalties on the books today were not in place when the inappropriate marketing of opioids was
alleged to have occurred. The maximum penalty for past offences under the Food and Drugs Act was
$5,000 per offence. This means that the Government of Canada could spend millions of dollars and
years building a case for criminal charges, with the prospect of only a small fine as a penalty.
Since that time, however, the Food and Drugs Act has been amended to dramatically strengthen the
penalties available. Should a similar situation arise today, the maximum penalty is now up to $5 million
per offence. In addition, if the offence involves “knowingly or recklessly causing a serious risk of injury to
human health,” the fine is left entirely to the discretion of the court, with nocap on the financial
penalty.
These penalties could not be applied to situations that arose before the changes in the law. Hence, our
focus is on enforcement of the laws as they exist today and preventing improper marketing practices in
the future.
Health Canada has further restricted the marketing and advertising of opioids by imposing additional
Terms and Conditions for prescription opioid-containing products. The additional Terms and Conditions
restricts all advertising materials of Class B opioids provided to health care professionals to only
statements that have been authorized by Health Canada in the Product Monograph.
Health Canada has also launched a web-based platform titled Stop Illegal Marketing of Drugs and
Devices to raise awareness about illegal marketing of drugs and medical devices, educate health care
professionals on the rules governing health product advertising in Canada, as well as provide a quick and
easy tool to report suspected misleading marketing practices to Health Canada. A page of this platform
is dedicated to the advertising of controlled substances, including opioids.
As part of our commitment to openness and transparency, we’re making more information available to
the public, including records of our meetings and correspondence with stakeholders.
SECTION 56(1) REQUESTS TO ALLOW FORPERSONAL POSSESSION
• Substanceuse is shaped by complex factors. It is clear that solutions to the overdose crisis must
consider broader health and social issues.
• At the request of the province of B.C., a three-year exemption has been granted so that adults in
the province will not be subject to criminal charges for personal possession of small amounts of certain
illegal drugs.
• This time-limited exemption, which will come into effect on January 31, 2023, is one part of BC’s
and the federal government’s broader responses to the overdose crisis.
IF PRESSED ON THE RATIONALE FOR THEDECISION
• The toll of the overdose crisis and the toxic drug supply continue to devastate communities. Too
many lives have been lost and countless others have been forever altered.
• British Columbia requested an exemption related to the personal possession of small amounts
of certain illegal drugs as one part of the province’s comprehensive approach to address the overdose
crisis.
• Throughout the exemption period, the federal government will work withthe province to
analyze the data and evidence, and assess impact to ensure this exemption continues to be the right
decision for the people of B.C.
IF PRESSED ON THRESHOLDS
• In assessing this exemption request, the dual objectives of the CDSA-toprotect public health
and maintain public safety–must be considered.
• This is a novel approach in Canada and data and evidence on the impact of effective threshold
amounts is limited, especially in the context of the increasingly toxic drug supplyin Canada and
internationally.
• In making the decision to grant an exemption in B.C. with a 2.5 grams cumulative threshold of
the listed drugs, several sources of data were carefully considered, including purchasing and use
patterns, public health data, and law enforcement data including drug seizures.
• As the first exemption of its kind in Canada, its implementation will be rigorously monitored and
evaluated to measure progress toward objectives and intended outcomes, and to identify unintended
consequencesand other potential risks.
IF PRESSED ON THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE THRESHOLD AND FENTANYL
• This exemption is one tool within a comprehensive response that must also include evidence-
based prevention efforts, a focus on disrupting drug trafficking, and improved access to treatment and
harm reduction services including pharmaceutical-grade alternatives (safer supply)for those at risk of
overdose.
• Rigorous monitoring and evaluation of this exemption will be critical, particularly in the face of
an increasingly toxic drug supply. The composition and purity of the drug supply varies, including the
presence of strong opioids such as fentanyl. Further, the amount of a drug a person may possess does
not necessarily equate to the amount they will use at one time.
• Should concerns arise, there are various tools available to address them, up to and including
revocation of the exemption.
• Anyone who uses illegal drugs should continue to engage in harm reduction measures to reduce
the risk of overdose and death.
IF PRESSED ON EVIDENCE AND EVALUATION
• This is a novel approach for B.C. This time-limited exemption will be supported by rigorous
monitoring and third party evaluation to gather evidence and data on the impact and outcomes of the
exemption and help to inform Canada’s comprehensive approach to addressing substance use harms.
• Throughout the exemption period, the federal government will work with the province to
analyze the data and evidence, and assess impact to ensure this exemption continues to be the right
decision for the people of B.C.
IF PRESSED ON NEW REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTIONS FROMOTHER JURISDICTIONS
• Health Canada will carefully and thoroughly review any request for an exemption to allow for
the personal possession of controlled substances on a case-by-case basis, including evidence of potential
benefits and risks to thehealth and safety of Canadians.
• The Department will continue to work with provincial and municipal officials on options that
address regional needs and help people who use substances get the support they need.
IF PRESSED ON PRIVATE MEMBER’S BILL C-216
• We recognise that more needs to be done to address the worsening overdose crisis.
• Through the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy, we are supporting a comprehensive
publichealth-focused approach. This includes commitments of over $800M to address the overdose
crisis and substance use-related harms since 2017.
• We are also supporting measures to divert people who use drugs away from the criminal justice
system and towards health and social services, as in Bill C-5, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
BACKGROUND
The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) generally prohibits activities (e.g. possession,
production, sale) with controlled substances and precursors (including chemicals used to make illegal
drugs), unless those activities have been specifically authorized through regulations or an exemption
under the Act. Current criminal penalties for simple possession of some controlled substances can
include imprisonment up to seven years and/or fines.
Section 56 of the CDSA allows the Minister of Health to exempt any person or class of persons or any
controlled substance or precursor or class thereof from the application of all or any of the provisions of
the Act or the regulations if, in the opinion of the Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical or
scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.
As the overdose crisis continues to worsen, there have been increasing calls from stakeholders,
including health professionals, law enforcement and people with lived and living experience, for the
removal of criminal penalties for the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use in order to
treat substance use as a health issue, reduce stigma around substance use and help connect people who
use drugs with health and social services.
Calls from jurisdictions across Canada to allow for personal possession of controlled substances are
increasing. To date HC is aware of over fifty-five municipalities who have publicly expressed interest in
decriminalization of personal possession. Several municipalities are studying or have advocated for the
federal government to decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal use, including Regina,
Saskatoon, Montreal and Ontario’s Big City Mayors (mayors from the province’s 29 largest cities).
On May 28, 2021, the City of Vancouver submitted its application with respect to its request for a
section 56 exemption under the CDSA to allow for the personal possession of certain amounts of
controlled substances. On November 1, 2021, British Columbia submittedan application with respect to
its request for a section 56 exemption under the CDSA to allow for the personal possession of certain
controlled substances commonly associated with overdose deaths in the province. On January 4, 2022,
Toronto Public Healthsubmitted its request for a section 56 exemption under the CDSA to decriminalize
personal possession of small amounts of controlled substances within the city’s boundaries. During a
December 6 Board of Health (BoH) meeting, the Toronto BoH also reiteratedits call to request the
Federal Minister of Health to use their authority under the CDSA to develop a national framework to
permit the possession of certain amounts of controlled substances for personal use; and support the
immediate scale up of prevention, harm reduction and treatment services. The requests from British
Columbia, Vancouver, and Toronto Public Health are currently under review. Several other
municipalities have reached out to Health Canada for additional information on the exemption process
for such requests including Calgary (December 18, 2021) and Edmonton (January 25, 2022). In response,
Health Canada has provided the type of information that could be helpful in informing the Department’s
review.
The requests received propose differentways to define personal possession. BC proposed one
cumulative threshold for opioids, cocaine, methamphetamine, and MDMA. Vancouver is proposing
specific thresholds for commonly used substances, including those associated with the overdose crisis as
well as others such as psychedelics and diverted marketed products. Toronto Public Health has not yet
submitted details on how it would define possession.
As part of the federal government’s urgent response to the overdose crisis, on May 31, 2022, at the
request of British Columbia’s Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Canada’s federal Minister of
Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health granted a 3-year exemption under the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) for adults in the province of British Columbia (BC) to
possess small amounts of certain illegal drugs for personal use.
This means is that from January 31, 2023 to January 31, 2026, adults 18 years and older, in the province
of BC, will not be subject to criminal charges for the personal possession of up to 2.5 grams of opioids,
cocaine, methamphetamine, or MDMA, or any combination thereof. Instead, these individuals will, at
minimum, be provided with information on local health and social services. They can also be provided
with assistance to connect with those services, if requested. This exemption is very specific as it covers
possession for personal use only and does not allow possession with the intent to traffic, produce or
export. To maintain public safety, the exemption does not apply in certain locations and situations (e.g.
the premises of daycares and schools, airports, to minors operating a motor vehicle or watercraft, etc.).
In addition to requests from jurisdictions to decriminalize simple possession, the Canadian Association
of People who Use Drugs (CAPUD) and four individual plaintiffs filed a Notice of Civil Claim on August 31,
2021 in the British Columbia Supreme Court that aims to decriminalize possession of all drugs, as well as
drug trafficking activitiesthat are connected to subsistence, supporting personal drug use, or providing a
safe supply of drugs to other people who use drugs (“necessity trafficking”). The Government of Canada
filed a Response to Civil Claim on November 30, 2021, which sets out thefacts and basic legal arguments
of the Government of Canada’s defence. The plaintiffs filed a reply to the Government of Canada’s
response on December 23, 2021. The litigation generated some media attention in September, and
continued interest is anticipated.
Under the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy, the Government of Canada has taken a number of
steps to help create pathways away from the criminal justice system toward appropriate health services
and social supports for people who use drugs. Thisincludes:
• In May 2017, the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act became law. It provides some legal
protection related to personal possession for individuals who seek emergency help during an overdose.
• On August 18, 2020, the Public Prosecution Serviceof Canada issued public guidance to
prosecutors stating that alternatives to prosecution should be considered for personal possession
offences, except when there are serious aggravating circumstances.
On December 15, 2021, Gord Johns, Member of Parliament for Courtenay-Alberni, BC (NDP), introduced
Private Member’s Bill C-216, an Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to enact the
Expungement of Certain Drug-related Convictions Act and the National Strategy on Substance Use Act,
in the House of Commons. The Bill is divided into three parts:
• Part 1 would repeal sections 4 and 4.1 of the CDSA, thereby removing the prohibition on
possession of controlled substances (i.e. subsection 4(1) of the CDSA) and other provisions;
• Part 2 would establish a procedure for expunging convictions related to possession of controlled
substances through the Parole Board of Canada; and
• Part 3 would require the Minister of Health to develop a national strategy to address substance-
related harms.
The first hour of debate at second reading took place on March 2, 2022.
In February 2021, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General introduced Bill C-22 in Parliament, An Act
to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Amongst other measures, the
Bill would have police and prosecutors consider alternative measures–including diverting individuals to
addiction programs, giving a warning or taking no further actions–instead of laying charges or
prosecuting individuals for simple drug possession. Bill C-22 died on the order paper with the calling of
the 2021 federal election. These proposed measures were reintroduced in the House of Commons on
December 7, 2021, through Bill C-5.
LEGISLATIVEREVIEW OF THE CANNABISACT
• The Cannabis Act established a new control framework for cannabis designed to better protect
public health and public safety, and minimize harms associated with cannabis use.
• The Act requires a legislative review to start three years after coming into force, and a report to
be tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 18 months after the review begins.
• Our Government is committed to putting into place a credible, evidence-driven process for the
legislative review, which will assess the progress made towards achieving the Act’s objectives.
IF PRESSED ON INCLUDING THE MEDICAL ACCESSREGIME IN THE REVIEW
• Health Canada is committed to actively monitoring and evaluating patients’ reasonable access
tocannabis for medicalpurposes.
• Health Canada acknowledges the significant stakeholder interest in the access to cannabis for
medical purposes framework and recognizes the opportunity that the legislative review presents to hear
the views and perspectives of these stakeholders.
BACKGROUND
The Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018, creating a strict legal framework for controlling
the production, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis across Canada. The Act aims to keep
cannabis out of the hands of youthand keep profits out of the pockets of criminals and organized crime.
Section 151.1 of the Cannabis Act requires that the Minister initiate a review of the Act and its
administration three years following the coming into force of the Act (i.e., after October 17, 2021), and
that a report of the review’s findings be tabled before both Houses of Parliament within 18 months of
the start of the review.
The Cannabis Act further stipulates that the review must include an assessment of the impact of the
CannabisAct on public health and, in particular, on: the health and consumption habits of young
persons in respect of cannabis use; Indigenous persons and communities; and, the cultivation of
cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.
Over the past three years, the Minister of Health, with the support of the Minister of Public Safety and
Emergency Preparedness and the Minister of Justice, and together with provinces and territories, as well
as Indigenous leaders, have worked diligently to implement the cannabis legislative framework.
The Government of Canada has made progress toward the implementation of the cannabis framework
by putting in place measures aimed at protecting children and youth from accessing cannabis;
establishing a strictly regulated, legal supplychain for cannabis, and by making significant investments in
public education, awareness, research, monitoring and surveillance efforts.
The review provides an initial and early opportunity to assess progress towards achieving the objectives
of the Act, and to help ensure that the legislation is meeting the needs and expectations of Canadians
through a credible, evidence-driven review process.
Health Canada has been actively monitoring the perspectives of stakeholders, including industry, public
health experts, and the law enforcement community and is taking into account the views and
expectations of stakeholders as we prepare for the review. Particular emphasis has been placed on early
engagement with Indigenous communities and to helping ensure that thereview process reflects their
interests and expectations.
EXEMPTION REQUEST DRUG USER LIBERATION FRONT (DULF)
• On April 21, 2022, Health Canada issued a letter indicating its intent to refuse the exemption
request fromthe Drug User Liberation Front (DULF) and the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users
(VANDU) to purchase illegal drugs from illegal vendors on the dark web and offer them for sale at cost to
members of their cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine compassion clubs.
• The health and safety of Canadians is a priority for the Government of Canada. Each request for
an exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking
into account all relevant considerations, including the public health and public safety objectives of the
Act and evidence of potential benefits and risks or harms to Canadians.
• Supplying drugs from the dark web is not a viable option for advancing the objectives of the
CDSA, namely the protection of public health and the maintenance of public safety.
• The Government of Canada remains committed to supporting efforts to expand access to a safer
supply, including exploring alternative models that will reduce and remove existing barriers to access.
IF PRESSED ON THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY DULF FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF THE LETTER
• Health Canada officials are carefully reviewing the additional information that has been
provided by DULF following receipt of the letter of intent to refuse their application regarding the supply
of illegal drugs through illegal vendors on the dark web.
• It is not Health Canada’s practice to discuss applications that are currently under review.
IF PRESSED ON SAFER SUPPLY
• Our Government understands the pandemic has led to an increasingly dangerous and
unpredictable illegal drug supply.
• Through the Substance Use and Addictions Program we have taken action to save lives by
funding projects that provide people who use drugs with safer, pharmaceutical-grade alternativesto the
toxic illegal drug supply as well as offer services that support people who use drugs.
• Since 2019, the Government has committed over $63 million in funding for 17 safer supply
projects in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, and one national community of
practice.
BACKGROUND
More than 9,191 British Columbians have died from illicit drug poisoning since April 2016, when the
Province declared a public health emergency, until March 2022. The number of deaths in 2021 (2,224)
was the highest ever recorded in a calendar year, with an average of 6.1 deaths per day. This represents
a 26% increase from 2020 (1,767 deaths) and a 127% increase from 2019 (982). Safer supply programs
form an important part of the federal government’s comprehensive response to this crisis, but these
programsare limited in number and a variety of factors (e.g. eligibility requirements, limited substance
options, etc.), have created barriers to access for many people who use drugs (PWUD).
On August 31st, 2021, Health Canada received a request from the Drug User Liberation Front (DULF) in
coordination with the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), for a subsection 56(1)
exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) to operate a Safe Supply Fulfillment
Centre and Cocaine, Heroin and Methamphetamine (CHM) Compassion Clubs in Vancouver, British
Columbia. DULF and VANDU suggest that the proposed model would address factors that currently act
as barriers for people who use drugs in accessing a safer supply in Canada.
The CDSA is the federal drug control statute with a dual purpose to protect public health and maintain
public safety. Under the CDSA, activities with controlled substances are generally prohibited (e.g.,
possession, production, importing, exporting, and trafficking) unless authorized through regulations or
exemptions. For situations where a legitimate activity with controlled substances does not fall under
existing regulations, section 56 of the CDSA provides flexibility to allow such activities to take place.
Subsection 56(1) of the CDSA provides the Minister of Health with the authority to exempt persons or
substances from the application of any provision of the CDSA or its regulations, if, in the opinion of the
Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical or scientific purpose, or is otherwise in the public
interest.
The request from DULF/VANDU proposes purchasing illegally produced controlled substances from
illegal vendors on dark web markets, testing the substances for the presence of contaminants, labelling
them, andthen selling, at cost, to compassion club members. Requirements for club membership are
proposed to be a minimum age of 18 years and a demonstration of current use of illegal substances.
Peer support would be available at time of purchase and through follow-up. Given the novelty of the
proposed model, the requesters would work with local researchers to conduct a mixed-methods
evaluation. The requesters also express openness to an alternative model, involving purchasing
pharmaceutical-grade substances froma licensed dealer, which would then be sold, at cost, to
compassion club members. That said, the request does not include any details of how this alternative
model would work and thus has not been considered in the assessment.
The dark web describes a portion of the internet that is intentionally difficult to access and provides
anonymity for those who use it. Illegal marketplaces operating over the dark web sell a variety of
controlled substances. Domestic and international organized crime groups are heavily involved in the
import, production, and sale of these controlled substances.
The Vancouver City Council has endorsed the DULF and VANDU exemption request if a pharmaceutical-
grade supply is used. If approved, Vancouver Coastal Health has agreed to work with DULF and VANDU
on implementation. While the current proposal mentions the idea of obtaining a pharmaceutical-grade
supply, the request itself focuses exclusively on the model involving the dark web.
On September 23, 2021, DULF submitted an application for funding through the Substance Use and
Addiction Program (SUAP) to support its proposed compassion club model. A decision has been made by
Health Canada to deny funding for this project. Decision letters were sent to applicants the week of
March 21, 2022.
Over the past two years, DULF has been using crowdsourced donations to purchase controlled
substances from the dark web. These substances have been tested, then labelled and distributed free of
charge to PWUD at a series of events in Vancouver. Although the Vancouver Police Department (VPD)
has not taken enforcement actions in relation to these distribution events, they have indicated that this
has been discretionary and they could undertake enforcement if they believe it is in the public interest.
They have identified the for-profit sale of drugs or the distribution of substances containing potentially
lethal doses of fentanyl as circumstances that would warrant enforcement.
PSYCHEDELICS
• We are deeplyconcerned about the burden of mental illness on Canadians, their families, and
their communities.
• While psychedelics like MDMA and psilocybin [sai·luh·sai·bn] have shown promise in clinical
trials for the treatment of some illnesses, further research isstill needed.
• Clinical trials are the most appropriate and effective way to advance research with unauthorized
drugs, like psilocybin and MDMA, because they have safeguards in place to protect thehealth and safety
of patients.
• I'm very happy to report that the number of authorized clinical trials with these substances has
increased significantly over the past year-a trend our government is hoping will continue.
IF PRESSED ON PSILOCYBIN EXEMPTION REQUESTS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS
• Health Canada is aware that psilocybin is being studied by researchersin Canada and
internationally.
• At this time, there are no approved therapeutic products containing psilocybinor MDMA in
Canada or elsewhere.
• Health Canada has undertaken further consultations and concluded that clinical trials are the
most appropriate mechanism for health care professionals who wish to improve their knowledge of
psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
• Clinical trials ensure that the interests of patients are protected and that a product is
administered in accordance with national and international ethical, medical, and scientific standards.
IF PRESSED ON RECENT CBC ARTICLE AND THE RELATED COMPLAINT OF MISCONDUCT ATMAPS
CLINICAL TRIAL
• Protecting the health and safety of patients, including those in clinical trials, is of the utmost
importance to Health Canada.
• Health Canada is aware of the serious allegations related to the Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) clinical trial recently reported in the media, and received a related complaint
on March 4, 2022, from a group of scholars and journalists inthe field of psychedelics.
• The complaint reported potential issues of research integrity, ethics and safety in five MDMA
trials conducted byMAPS. The complainants requested greater safeguards to ensure the safety of study
participants, especially to address the risk of suicide. The complainants noted that allegations related to
investigator misconduct had been reported to law enforcement and to the College of Physicians and
Surgeons of British Columbia.
IF PRESSED ON THE ACTIONS BY HEALTH CANADA RELATED TOTHE MAPS COMPLAINT
• Health Canada has determined that of the trials referenced in the complaint, one was not
conducted in Canada, two ofthe trials conducted in Canada are completed, and of the two other
approved trials, one does not have any sites in Canada, and the other has two active sites that are open
to enrollment.
• One of the completed trials was inspected in2019 and was found compliant.
• The Department has completed its review of the complaint information and all previously
authorised Clinical Trial Applications involving the use of MDMA. The review has not indicated a need
for additional compliance and enforcement action.
• The Department will be prioritizing onsite inspections for any active trial sites involving MDMA.
If PRESSED ON PATIENT PROTECTIONIN CLINICAL TRIALS
• Health Canada recognizes the importance of Canadians having access to safe clinical trials.
• HealthCanada’s role includes a rigorous, science-based review of all clinical trial applications in
Canada, and subsequent inspection activities to help ensure compliancewith Good Clinical Practices.
• Research Ethics Boards ensure the protection of participants, while Colleges of Physicians and
Surgeons ensure quality care is provided by their members.
• When clinical trials include psychedelics, additional safeguards are implemented to protect
patients.
• Together, these measures offer layers of protectionto minimize and address risks throughout a
clinical trial.
IF PRESSED ON SECTION 56(1) EXEMPTIONS FOR PSILOCYBIN
• The Government of Canada recognizes that many Canadians with terminal andchronic illness
are suffering.
• The safety and well-being of Canadians is the paramount concern. At this time, there are no
approved therapeutic products containing psilocybin in Canada or elsewhere.
• This means there is no product containing psilocybin that has been assessed for itssafety,
efficacy and quality.
• Clinical trials remain the best method to advance our knowledge about products with a possible
medical benefit, such as psilocybin. Clinical trials protect patients by providing a framework so that a
potential treatment is administered in accordance withnational and international ethical, medicaland
scientific standards.
• For emergency treatment purposes or by exception, and on compassionate grounds, there are
pathways to access these substances.
• Health Canada's Special Access Program (SAP) permitshealth care practitioners to request
access to drugs that have shown promise in clinical trials, or been approved in other countries, but that
have not yet been approved for sale in Canada.
• By exception, and on compassionate grounds, patients can seek an exemption under subsection
56(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Actto possess and use psilocybin.
• Health Canada continues to prioritize exemption requests from terminally ill patients to treat
end-of-life psychological distress.
IF PRESSEDON HOW EXEMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED
• Each request for an exemption is carefully reviewed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account
all relevant considerations, including evidence of potential benefits and risks or harms to Canadians.
• In the case of psilocybin, Health Canada’s review includes consideration of the individual’s
medical condition, whether conventional therapies and other regulatory pathways have been
considered, and the scientific evidence available to support the request.
• The Department continues to process requests for exemptions, while prioritizing requests from
patients who are terminally ill.
IF PRESSED ON THE SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAM AND ACCESS TO A “SECURESUPPLY” OF PSILOCYBIN
• Health Canada has not evaluated the efficacy and safetyof psilocybin, nor has it approved its
sale for therapeutic use underthe Food and Drug Regulations.
• As of January 5, 2022, health care practitioners can request access, on behalf of patients with
serious or life-threatening conditions, to restricted drugs such as psilocybin, through the Special Access
Program. All requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the patient’s
condition, availability of other treatment options, and available evidence of the safety and efficacy of
the drug.
BACKGROUND
USE OF PSYCHEDELICS FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES IN CANADA
Canadians are increasingly seeking novel approaches for the treatment of mental health issues. As such,
interest in the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics for the treatment of mental health disorders is
on the rise.
Psilocybin is one of the active ingredients in magic mushrooms, while MDMA is a synthetic compound
made in laboratories. There are many different kinds of psychedelics including LSD (acid), DMT
(ayahuasca),mescaline (peyote), etc. Many psychedelics are being studied as an adjunct therapy
alongside conventional psychotherapeutic techniques in clinical settings. This is also known as
psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
Most psychedelics (also known as hallucinogens) are controlled as “restricted drugs” under the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Restricted drugs generally have no approved therapeutic
uses and can only be used for research or scientific purposes, including in authorized clinical trials. No
products containing psilocybin have been approved in the US, Canada, or internationally.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated psilocybin as a “breakthrough-
therapy” for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression/Major Depressive Disorder. Similarly,
MDMA has received “breakthrough-therapy” designation for the treatment of PTSD by the FDA. A
“breakthrough-therapy” designation is a process designed to fast track the drug review and approval
process for drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence
indicates that the drug may be a substantial improvement over existing therapeutic options for a
particular medical condition.
ACCESS TO PSILOCYBIN
Psychedelics are subject to legal controls under the Food and Drugs Act and the CDSA. This means that
access to psilocybin and other psychedelic restricted drugs must be authorized by Health Canada. At this
time, there are three possible options for individuals to access restricted drugs, namely through
participation in an approved clinical trial, through the Special Access Program, and through a subsection
56(1) exemption under the CDSA.
Clinical trials
Health Canada has taken a number of steps to encourage further clinicalresearch on psychedelics.
Health Canada has hosted two Clinical Trials 101 information sessions (in July 2021 and March 2022) to
provide an overview of the clinical trial application process to researchers interested in conducting
clinical trials with psychedelics. Health Canada also published a Notice to Stakeholders outlining the
general requirements to conducting clinical research with psilocybin and has met with numerous
researchers to clarify data requirements.
Health Canada has also approved severalclinical trials with psilocybin and MDMA since 2018. These
include clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psilocybin in patients with depression or treatment-
resistant depression, the safety of low-doses of psilocybin, and the safety of psilocybin for health care
providers enrolled in a psychedelic training program. In Spring 2022, the Canadian Institutes of Health
Research will be launching a funding opportunity that will provide up to $3 million to support clinical
trials looking at the safety and early efficacy of using psilocybin in combination with psychotherapy for
the treatment of substance use and mental health disorders.
Safety Requirements for Clinical Trials
Organizations at the federal and provincial/territorial levels have different roles with respect to the
regulation and oversight of clinical trials. Together, they offer layers of protection to Canadians, using
various measures to minimize and address risks before, during and after a clinical trial.
Under the Food and Drugs Act (Act) and related regulations, Health Canada conducts rigorous, science-
based reviews of all clinical trial applications in Canada, in accordance with the objectives of the Act, to
protect the health and safety of clinical trial participants. In general, for all clinical trials, sponsors must
demonstrate that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate risks to participants; that potential risks
are communicated to and accepted by participants; and that approval by a Research Ethics Board has
been obtained. In clinical trials involving MDMA, known for potentially inducing emotional vulnerability,
additional safeguards have been implemented. These safeguards have included, for example in the case
of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) clinical trials, that MDMA trials must
be video recorded to minimize the risk of abuse and to verify that the therapy was properly conducted.
Although complaints have been rare, when the Department becomes aware of a complaint or possible
misconduct related to a clinical trial that could put the physical and mental health of the subjects at risk
or affect the integrity of the clinical data, steps are taken to verify whether the requirements of the Act
and related regulations are being met.
Should non-compliance be identified, the Department has a number of compliance and enforcement
options available to correct non-compliance or mitigate the risk to Canadians, including requiring
corrective actions, trial suspension or cancellation.
Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) Clinical Trial
MAPS is a non-profit research and educational organization conducting international clinical trials on
MDMA-assisted therapy as a treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other conditions.
MAPS has sponsored a multitude of clinical studies over more than a decade; over that period, MAPS
has received five complaints.
Complaint Received by Health Canada in 2019:
The MAPS clinical trial that was the object of sexual misconduct allegations wasauthorized in March
2009. A complaint from a participant in this clinical trial was submitted to Health Canada in 2019, after
the clinical trial was closed (October 2016).
Following receipt of the complaint, in 2019 Health Canada conducted a compliance verification as well
as a full inspection of a related MAPS clinical trial. During the inspection, the Department confirmed that
the unlicensed therapist, who was the subject of the original complaint, was no longer working at the
site. The Department observed that adequate steps related to Good Clinical Practices requirements had
been taken by the sponsor and the site, with regards to the complaint, including:
• notification of the Research Ethics Boards,
• modification to the consent form to include emotional vulnerability as a risk,
• development and implementation of MAPS MDMA Therapy Training on Code of Ethics,
• continuation of the standard model of 2 facilitators per study visit, with video recording of all in-
person psychotherapy and all telemedicine visits, and,
• continuation of the requirement for night attendants at the site to be licensed mental health
practitioners.
On January 7, 2020, the complainant was informed of Health Canada’s findings and was advised that the
College of Physicians andSurgeons of British Columbia should be consulted regarding any concerns
related to the conduct of the therapists and physicians involved in the study.
Complaint received by Health Canada in 2022:
In March 2022, Health Canada received a complaint from a group of scholars and journalists who
claimed to be experts in the field of psychedelics. Allegations included inadequate eligibility and
withdrawal criteria, inadequate disclosure of risks in the informed consent form, and inadequate
duration of follow-up related to MDMA trials conducted by MAPS. The complainants requested greater
safeguards to ensure the safety of study participants, especially to address the risk of suicide.
The Department has reviewed the adequacy of the protocol design and informed consent documents of
previously authorised trials, in light of these allegations. Additional information has been requested
from sponsors, regarding adverse events, efficacy data, complaints from participants and actions taken
by the sponsor. While no concernshave been identified, to date, Health Canada will not hesitate to take
appropriate compliance and enforcement action should non-compliance with the Food and Drugs Act
and its associated regulations be identified.
Status and Next Steps
On April 27, the Department participated in its quarterly trilateral meeting with the U.S. FDA and the UK
MHRA and discussed the MAPS complaint received by HC and the FDA. Health Canada will meet with the
U.S. FDA again on May 16, to discuss Health Canada’s participation inthe FDA’s planned inspection of
MAPS in June (note that thisis not for public disclosure).
On May 4, Health Canada met with the BC College of Physicians and Surgeons to discuss the information
received as part of the MAPS clinical trial complaint and thepublication of its inspection findings.
In June 2022, ROEB will be conducting two MDMA clinical trial inspections to verify that the trials are
being conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices requirements, per Division 5 of the Food and
Drug Regulations. One trial is sponsored by the Remedy Institute and the other by MAPS (not for public
disclosure at this time).
Health Canada has assessed this situation. The Department has concluded that its own regulations are
appropriate to manage clinicaltrials with psychedelics and that protocols and informed consent forms
address potential risks. We will also ensure that all sponsors wishing to conduct clinical trials with
MDMA have adequate risk management measures in place to minimize the risks of emotional
vulnerability. Health Canada will continue to work with its national and international partners on this
file, and would be supportive of measures taken by Research Ethics Boards and provincial and territorial
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, todevelop and implement more safeguards to help avoid
repetition of this situation in the future, in particular around professional standards.
Special Access Program
On January 5, 2022, regulatory amendments were made to the Food and Drug Regulations and Narcotic
Control Regulations allowing practitioners, on behalf of patients with serious or life-threatening
conditions, to request access to restricted drugs through the Special Access Program when other
therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable in Canada. All requests will continue to be
assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the patient’s condition and the level of
evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of the drug. These regulatory changes were shared with all
interested parties, including organizations that represent patients seeking to possess and use psilocybin
for therapeutic purposes. As of May 2022, Health Canada has authorized 9 requests for psychedelics
through SAP for a total of 14 patients. None of these authorisations were for MDMA.
Individual subsection 56(1) exemptions
As for exemptions, Health Canada continues to receive a high volume of requests pertaining to
psilocybin, and, more recently, MDMA. Health Canada continues to prioritize exemption requestsfrom
terminally ill patients seeking access to psilocybin for the treatment of end-of-life distress.
Many factors are considered when reviewing and making a decision on a request for a subsection 56(1)
exemption to use psilocybin in relation to a medicalcondition. These factors may include but are not
limited to (as per Health Canada web page):
• The availability of clinical trials or other regulatory pathways, such as the Special Access
Program, to request access to the substance
• The medical conditionfor which the psilocybin is requested to be used
• The existing scientific evidence to support the use of psilocybin for the treatment of the
condition
• Whether other conventional therapies have been considered
• Whether the use of the substances is supported by a health care practitioner
• Public health and public safety objectives of the CDSA
• Other federal, provincial, and/or municipal laws or regulations that may apply to the proposed
activity
• Risks, including risk of diversion
Number ofPatient-Requested Exemptions Approved
Health Canada has granted exemptions under subsection 56(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act to patients with serious or life threatening illnesses, when conventional treatments have failed, to
allow them topossess psilocybin while undergoing psychotherapy, as well as to a small number of
health care professionals for professional training purposes. Total subsection 56(1) exemptions issued
for possession and use of psilocybin included below.
Psilocybin subsection 56(1) exemptions issued-total as of February 28, 2022:
Patients
Issued: 81 exemptions
Health care professionals
Issued: 19 exemptions
SUBSTANCE USE STIGMA
• Our government is committed to reducing the stigma associated withsubstance use so that
Canadians feel safe asking for help and,when they do, get quality care.
• Addiction is a treatable medical condition which is why we should be diverting people towards
health and social services.
• We are taking action to reduce stigma through public education and funding for community
initiatives, while prioritizing engagement of people with lived and living experience.
IF PRESSED ON PUBLIC EDUCATION TO REDUCE STIGMA
• Since 2016, the Governmentof Canada has invested approximately $22.8M in public education
to raise awareness on the risks of opioids, overdose prevention, harm reduction and stigma.
• The Government has invested in prevention campaigns for youth which include raising
awareness of the impacts of stigma on people who use drugs, and how to reduce it.
• We have also funded important public education initiatives led by non-government
organizations who are able to reach higher-risk populations, such as men working in the trades.
IF PRESSED ON THE LINK BETWEEN STIGMAAND THE BC EXEMPTION
• Stigma related to substance use can lead people to hide their substance use, use in riskier ways,
and prevent them from accessing services and supports.
• Granting an exemption for personal possessionof small amounts of certain illegal drugs in
British Columbia is an important step in treating substance use as a health issue, not as a criminal one.
BACKGROUND
Substance use stigma has serious consequences on the lives of people who use substances, their
families and communities. Evidence shows that widespread stigma discourages people from seeking
health and social services, reduces the quality of services received, and leads people to hide their
substance use or use alone. Stereotypes and stigma also lowers public support for, and funding of,
programs that aim to help people who use substances.
The use of stigmatizing and dehumanizing language, negative depictions of substance use in the media
and the misconception that addiction is a choice perpetuate stigma. Addiction is a diagnosable and
treatable medical condition, not a choice.
Stakeholders have reported that stigma and fear of criminalization cause some people to hide their
substance use, use alone, or use in other ways that increase risk of harms. Stakeholders have also
reported that stigma and fear act as barriers to many in accessing important health and social services,
including treatment and thatreducing stigma can help save lives. Canada is committed to treating
substance use as a health issue. The Federal Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate
Minister of Health’s granting of a time-limited exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act (CDSA) so that adults in British Columbia will not be subject to criminal charges for personal
possession of small amounts of certain illegal drugs, is a step towards this commitment.
The federal government has done considerable work toreduce substance use stigma, including
prioritizing the engagement of people with lived and living experience to inform our policies and
programs and investing in public education campaigns to reduce stigma and encourage help-seeking.
We support stigma reduction efforts in communities across Canada through funding and we continue to
work with other government departments, provinces and territories, and internationally to promote and
support stigma reduction efforts. Finally, we champion the use of non-stigmatizing language in all of our
communications and support others to do the same because we understand that language is a powerful
tool for reducing stigma.
We are committed to ensuring that stigma reduction is a key consideration in all of our work to reduce
substance use harms and promote the health of all Canadians.
NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES
• Budget 2021 provided $45 million to develop national standards for mental health and
substanceuse services, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key
stakeholders.
• National standards help to formalize what Canadians can expect in terms of the quality of
services while providing an evidence-based framework forservice delivery that Canadians can rely on,
no matter where they live or access services.
• Standards development will be informed by consultation and engagement processes, so that the
diverse perspectives of Canadians are incorporated, such as Indigenous and racialized populations,
gender-diverse people, and people with lived and living experience.
IF PRESSED ON WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO SUPPORT THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL STANDARDS
• Significant progress has been made todevelop and advance wise practices in mental health and
substance use treatment, supported by significant federal, provincial and territorial investments.
• This provides opportunities to build on and integrate wise practices in provinces and territories
to develop national standards, through consensus-based processes that address shared mental health
and substance use priorities.
• Standards will provide a framework for mental health and substance use service delivery across
Canada, no matter where a person lives.
IF PRESSED ON HOW THESE NATIONAL STANDARDS WILL IMPACT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND
SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES RECEIVED BY CANADIANS
• Mental health and substance use services can vary across the country and some people
experience barriers in accessing services. Where services are available, they may also not meet the
needs of diverse populations.
• Standards are tool for helping to ensure that mental health and substance use services,
including those who provide such services, meet a consistent level of care and are sensitive to a wide
range of needs.
• Standards will be informed by available evidence, guidance and wise practices, as well as the
perspectives of experts and other key stakeholders, including persons with lived and living experience.
• Thiswork will help to ensure that when Canadians access services, they are of high quality,
evidence-based and equitable.
IF PRESSED ON THE PARTNERSHIP WITH STANDARDS COUNCIL OF CANADA (SCC)
• On March 14, 2022, the Government of Canada announced plans for Health Canada to work
with SCC and stakeholders to develop national standards for mental health and substance use services.

are a tool for promoting consistency ofservice delivery across Canada.
• The Government of Canada and SCC will explore opportunities for standards development in
additional priority areas with input fromstakeholders.
IF PRESSED ON HOW STANDARDSWILL PROMOTE EQUITY
• We know that in order for standards to support all Canadians, they must be developed through
an equity lens that considers the needs of diverse populations.
• The Government of Canada hasemphasized the importance of engagement with diverse
stakeholders and promotion of health equity principles, which will be incorporated into the
development process.
• It is the Government of Canada’s intention to use the standards development process to
advance equity in the delivery of high-quality care for diverse populations that face barriers to care.
IF PRESSED ON HOW STANDARDS COUNCIL OF CANADA (SCC) WILL ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS
• SCC will engage a diverse range of key stakeholders to inform their work, including provinces
and territories, Indigenous partners, health organizations, and people with lived and living experience.
• SCC is establishing a National Mental Health and Substance Use Standardization Collaborative
model to facilitate stakeholder engagement as well as consensus-based processes, which includes a
steering committee and various working groups.

inform the developmentprocess.
• Stakeholders can also contact SCC for more information by accessing their dedicated webpage.
IF PRESSED ON HOW STANDARDS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED
• Standards will be available for voluntary implementation by provinces and territories, health
organizations and other service providers.
• Standards Council of Canada will develop guidance and related resources to support the uptake
and implementation of standards.
BACKGROUND
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, theGovernment of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government provided $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to develop national standards for mental health, in collaboration
with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that Canadians can access
timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to include standards for
substance use due to its close relationship with mental health.
National standards will be evidence-based and developed through consensus-based processes that
engage a range of experts, health organizations, people with lived and livingexperience, and other key
stakeholders. The Government of Canada has emphasized the importance of engagement with diverse
stakeholders and promotion of health equity principles, which will be incorporated into the
development process. National standards will be available for voluntary implementation in provinces,
territories and health organizations, and will help to support an evidence-based framework for service
delivery that Canadians can rely on.
Standards Background
“Standardization” refers to the development and application (conformity assessment) of standards
publications that establish accepted practices, technical requirements and terminologies for product,
process and service, for management systems and for certification of persons.
Standards are documents, established by consensus and approved by a recognized body that provide,
for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at
the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context. They are based on the consolidated
results of science, technology and lived and living experience, and aimed at the promotion of optimum
community benefits.
While there are a breadth of clinical and professional guidelines, frameworks, and other resources
currently available with a national scope, these documents have a specific focus and intended purpose
separate from national standards for health services or have otherwise not been developed through a
formal standardization process.
Partnership with Standards Council of Canada (SCC)
Health Canada signed a Memorandum of Agreement with SCC on November 25, 2021 to develop
national standards for mental health and substance use services. This partnership was announced by the
Minister of Mental Health and Addictions on March 14, 2022.
Established in 1970 through the Standards Council of Canada Act, SCC is a non-agent Federal Crown
Corporation. Oversight for the SCC is provided by its Governing Council, who are appointedby the
federal government and who report to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science, and
Economic Development. As set out in the Act, SCC’s mandate is to promote efficient and effective
voluntary standardization in Canada, where standardization is not expressly provided for by law and, in
particular, to:
a. promote the participation of Canadians in voluntary standards activities,
b. promote public-private sector cooperation in relation to voluntary standardization in Canada,
c. coordinate and oversee the efforts of the persons and organizations involved in the National
Standards System,
d. foster quality, performance and technological innovation in Canadian goods and services
through standards-related activities, and,
e. develop standards-related strategies and long-term objectives in order to advance the national
economy, support sustainable development, benefit the health, safety and welfare of workers and the
public, assist and protect consumers, facilitate domestic and international tradeand further
international cooperation in relation to standardization.
SCC coordinates and provides leadership to the National Standards System, which refers to the network
of organizations and individuals who contribute to standardization in Canada. Thisincludes SCC-
accredited organizations that develop standards (Standards Development Organizations or SDOs) as well
as SCC-accredited conformity assessment bodies that verify compliance to standards. SCC also facilitates
connections between the National Standards System and the international standardization system.
As Canada’s National Standards Body, SCC leads and provides a strategic approach to national
standardization, ensuring that national objectives and needs are served by the National Standards
System. SCC collaborates with SDOs to lead and facilitate the development of standards, and serves as a
convener and leader for the standards system, as well as the rules-setting body for standards
development in Canada.
Priority Areas for Standards Development
SCC will lead the development of an integrated suite of national standards products in six
priority areas that align with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities (CSOP):
• Children and youth:
1. Integrated Youth Services:increase access to youth mental health and substance use supports
that are integrated with physical health, sexual health and social services
• Primary Health Services Integration:
2. Primary Care Integration: increase access to quality, integrated mentalhealth and substance use
supports in primary care settings
3. Digital Mental Health and Substance Use Apps: improve access to high-quality, safe and
effective apps to help Canadians make better-informed app choices
• People with complex needs:
4. Substance Use Treatment Centres: improve access to high-quality, evidence-based care and
promote an integrated and coordinated treatment system
5. Substance Use Workforce: increase substance use workforce capacity to provide evidence-
based care and stepped-care approaches
6. Integrated Services for Complex Health Needs: improve integrated treatment approaches for
individuals with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders and complex health needs
SCC will develop standard products with the highest levelof consensus and rigor possible within the
short period available for development. The potential types of products include:
• National Standard of Canada (NSC): Full consensus document produced following an SCC-
accredited process by an SCC-accredited Standards Development Organization (SDO).
• Standards-based deliverables that can form the basis for upgrading to formal standards (i.e.,
NSCs):
• Technical Specification (TS): Fast-track document intended for rapid, emerging activities. Can
support pilot conformity assessment work.
• Publicly Available Specification (PAS): Initial standardization for a broad topic area, written by a
single leading author.
• Workshop Agreement (WA): Brings together thought leaders to agree on best practices.
Once published, all products can be implemented, applied, tested, and later revised or upgraded (if
applicable) to other standardized document types, such as NSCs.
SCC Governance Model for the Development of National Standards for Mental Health and Substance
Use Services
SCC will use a National Standardization Collaborative model to lead standards development through a
consensus-based process. This model includes in-depth stakeholder involvement, national
standardization strategy advancement processes, and subject matter expertise for each topic area, to
identify needs and gaps that will inform the scope and content of standards. The Collaborative’s
governance involves a tiered committee structure that includes a Steering Committee and working
groups with specific areas offocus.
The Collaborative will be composed of key stakeholders and implementation partners, including
representatives from: SCC, federal government, Indigenous organizations, Pan-Canadian Health
Organizations, experts, professional associations, service providers/organizations, Standards
Development Organizations, other non-governmental organizations, and persons with lived and living
experience. The selection of specific participants will be guided by GBA+ considerations, to ensure an
inclusive, equity-driven approach.
The Collaborative will also include a Government Advisory Table to provide a dedicated forum for PT
representatives to share their perspectives as the work progress. The Co-chairs of this Table will be
invited to join the Steering Committee ofthe Collaborative. PT representatives can also join the working
groups of the Collaborative. PTs can also remain informed of initiative progress through a dedicated
webpage hosted by SCC that is now live and will be updated regularly.
Relationship of Standards to the Canada Mental Health Transfer (CMHT)
Service standards are tools for promoting the delivery of high-quality and appropriate mental health and
substance use care in specific service areas. The focus of standards development is on how care is
delivered, where standards implementation lies within the jurisdiction of PTs that deliver care.
The suite of standards is not inclusive of all mental health and substance use services and will continue
to evolve over time with the emergence of new priority areas ready for standards development.
Complementary role of the CMHT:
The new CMHT would serve as a permanent source of funding to PTs to expand their capacity to deliver
high-quality, accessible and free mental health services, forboth preventionand treatment.
The government of Canada is committed to engaging with PTs on the development of a CMHT. A
negotiating mandate will be sought and could include identifying a temporary and permanent
mechanism for flowing this funding, the annual amounts, and associated conditionality (see below).
As a source of funds, the CMHT would play an important complementary role in supporting PTs to
implement standards by bolstering their capacity to deliver high-quality care.
Standards and CMHT conditionality:
The parameters and conditionality of the CMHT will focus on principles (e.g., universality, accessibility),
priorities and/or general conditions that apply to all mental health services. They will not be based on,
nor will they include, standards of care. Attempting to be more prescriptive, such as by compelling the
implementation of standards, could pose the legal risk to the federal government of being ultra vires
(i.e., beyond the scope or in excess of legal power or authority). In addition, as standards focus on
specific service areas, they are too narrow to frame the scope or conditions of the CMHT.
Standards will be made available for voluntary implementation in PTs, health organizations and other
service providers responsible for the delivery of mental health and substance use care.
Progress in Other Areas of Standards Development
Existing standards work funded by the federal government is already contributing to the advancement
of this mandate commitment.
• Health Canada is funding Health Standards Organization’s (HSO) Improving Integrated Care for
Youth (IICY) Initiative, to develop an effective integrated care network to address gaps in access to child
& youth mental health services and continuity of care. This work includes standards development inthe
following areas: Youth Mental Health and Addictions Services; Suicide Prevention; and Health and Social
Networks.
• Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) jointly developed with Canadian Standards
Association (CSA) and Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ), the Psychological Health and Safety in
the Workplace NSC, which was published in 2018. The MHCC continues to promote and support
implementation of the standard through education, guidance and training.
o This standard was adapted by the Paramedic Association of Canada to develop the Psychological
Health and Safety in the Paramedic Service Organization NSC, published in 2018.
• MHCC jointly developed with CSA, the Mental Health and Well-Being for Post-Secondary
Students NSC, which was published in 2020. MHCC continues to promote and support implementation
of the standard through education, guidance and training.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL STANDARDS?
• Significant progress hasbeen made to develop and advance wise practices in mental health and
substance use treatment, supported by significant federal, provincial and territorial investments.
• This provides opportunities to build on and integrate these practices in provinces and territories
to develop national standards, through consensus-based processes that address shared mental health
and substance use priorities.
• Standards will provide a framework for mental health and substance use service delivery across
Canada,no matter where a person lives.
HOW WILL NATIONAL STANDARDS AFFECT THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USESERVICES
RECEIVED BY CANADIANS?
• Mental health and substance use services can vary across the country and some people
experience barriers in accessing services. Where services are available, they may also not meet the
needs of diverse populations.
• Standards are tool for helping to ensure that mental health and substance use services,
including those who provide such services, meet a consistent level of care and are sensitive to a wide
range of needs.
• Standards will be informed by available evidence, guidance and wise practices, as well as the
perspectives of experts and other key stakeholders, including persons with lived and living experience.
• This workwill help to ensure that when Canadians access services, they are of high quality,
evidence-based and equitable.
HOW WILL THE STANDARDS BE DEVELOPED?
• Standards Council of Canada (SCC) will coordinate the development of standards that are
evidence-basedand developed through consensus-based processes that engage experts, health
organizations, people with lived and living experience, and other key stakeholders.
• Standards will seek to achieve the highest level of consensus and rigor possible, while adhering
to Standards Council of Canada’s strict guidelines for standards development.
WHAT ARE THE PRIOITY AREAS FOR STANDARDS?
• Standards Council of Canada (SCC) will focus standards development on priority areas that align
with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities (CSOP) developed by federal,
provincial and territorial governments in 2017.
• The standards will help address a range of mental health and substance use service needs and
are a tool for promoting consistency ofservicedelivery across Canada.
• The Government of Canada and SCC will explore opportunities for standards development in
additional priority areas with input from stakeholders.
HOW WILL THE STANDARDS PROMOTE EQUITY?
• We know that in order for standards to support all Canadians, they must be developed through
an equity lens that considers the needs of diverse populations.
• The Government of Canada has emphasized the importance of engagement with diverse
stakeholders and promotion of health equity principles, which will be incorporated into the
development process.
• It is the Government of Canada’s intention to use the standards development process to
advance equity in the delivery of high-quality care for diverse populations that face barriers to care.
HOWWILL THE STANDARDS COUNCIL OF CANADA (SCC) ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS?
• SCC will engage a diverse range of key stakeholders to inform their work, including provinces
and territories, Indigenous partners, health organizations, and people with lived and living experience.
• SCC is establishing a National Mental Health and Substance Use Standardization Collaborative
model to facilitate stakeholder engagement as well as consensus-based processes, which includes a
steering committee and various working groups.
WHATIS THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT WILL GUIDE THE STANDARDS COUNCIL OF CANADA (SCC)?
• The Steering Committee includes a diverse range of key mental health and substance use
stakeholders that will provide advice and direction tothe work of the Collaborative.
• Membership includes representatives from the federal government, Indigenous partners, pan-
Canadian health organizations, experts, professional associations, health organizations, standards
development organizations, non-governmental organizations, and people with lived and living
experience.
HOW WILL PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES BE ENGAGED IN STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT?
• Provinces and territories are key stakeholders that will be consulted throughout this process.
• A Government Advisory Table has been established to provide a dedicated forum for provinces
and territories that choose to contribute to thestandards development process.
• Representatives from the provinces and territories will also be invited to join the various
working groups within the Collaborative.
HOW CAN STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS?
• Canadians will have access to regular updates on this work through a dedicated webpage for the
initiative hosted by Standards Council of Canada (SCC).
• SCC will also launch a seriesof public consultations on the priority areas for standards to help
inform the development process.
• Stakeholders can also contact SCC for more information by accessing their dedicated webpage.
HOW WILLTHE STANDARDS BE IMPLEMENTED?
• Standards will beavailable for voluntary implementation by provinces and territories, health
organizations and other service providers.
• Standards Council of Canada will develop guidance and related resources to support the uptake
and implementation of standards.
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF BLACK CANADIANS
• Our Government recognizes the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians,
including anti-Black racism and its significant impacts on mental health.
• In 2018, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) launched the Promoting Health Equity:
Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund. With a budget of $10 million, the fund supports 23 community-
based projects across Canada to generate culturally focused knowledge and evidence.
• Budget 2021 committed further investments in mental health promotion and mental illness
prevention for those most affected by COVID-19. With these investments, PHAC launched a targeted
Call for Proposals in August 2021 to previous applicants who did not receive funding from the over-
subscribed Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund.
• The results of this process will support new community-based projects that will continue to take
into account the unique and diverse needs of Black Canadians throughout the pandemic and as part of
Canada’s recovery.
• Budget 2022 proposed an investment of $3.7 million over four years, starting in 2022-23, for the
Black-led engagement, design, and implementation of a Mental Health Fund for Black federal public
servants within the Treasury Boardof Canada Secretariat.
IF PRESSED ONSPECIFIC COMMITMENTS
• Recently, our Government was pleased to highlight two projects as part of our commitment to
supporting Black Canadian communities in Canada which are each receiving $400,000 in funding from
PHAC:
o The Harriet Tubman Institute at York University will use the funding to analyze racism in
academia, study the mental health of Black university students, develop relevant tools to support
university students from Black communities and further our understanding of culturally responsive
approaches to mental health issues.
o The TAIBU Community Health Centre will use the funding to develop a national knowledge
network. This network will aim to generate and mobilize Afrocentric knowledge, with the intentto build
capacity and address gaps in current knowledge about effective, culturally focused approaches and
programs to improve mental health for Black Canadians.
• We will continue to support funding to increase knowledge of the mental health needs of Black
Canadians and to create spaces for culturally responsive knowledge sharing and capacity building within
Black communities.
• This work is shaped through collaborative efforts with the Mental Health of Black Canadians
Working Group, an interdisciplinaryteam of Black Canadian experts in the social determinants of mental
health. PHAC provides secretariat support to this Working Group.
• PHAC’s Social Determinants of Health Division acts as the secretariat for the MHBC Working
Group, assisting in conveningmeetings, coordinating information-sharing and communications between
members and using learnings from the Working Group to further inform program on-going
implementation and future solicitations.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEED FOR RACE-BASED COVID-19 DATA
• Our Government recognizes the need for race-based data to understand and address the
disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Canadians andother racialized communities.
• PHAC is engaging with its partners to continue to undertake specialized surveys and enhanced
surveillance activities focused on the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 and the pandemic response
on key populations of interest, including racialized populations.
• Throughout this work, we will continue to prioritize consultation andengagement with Black
Canadians and other racialized communities to inform appropriate data collection, analysis and
dissemination approaches that respect privacy and avoid stigmatization and other potential harms of
race-based data collection.
IF PRESSEDON THE CURRENT EVENTS RELATEDTO ANTI-BLACK RACISM
• Our Government recognizes the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians and
other racialized populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Anti-Black racism is not just a public health issue. Racism in all of its forms has deep and long-
lasting impacts on health and well-being.
• PHAC’s Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund aims to support projects that work to improve
social conditions that can negatively impact mental health, includingexperiences of discrimination.
BACKGROUND
Experiences of racial discrimination throughout a lifetime can lead to chronic stress and trauma.
Increased anxiety and social exclusion as a result of the health, economic and social effects of COVID-19
cancompound poor mental health outcomes, especially for racialized populations. Findings from a
recent survey on the impacts of the pandemic on mental health indicate that 27.9% of Black Canadians
(vs. 22.9% of White Canadians) reported fair or poor mental health in the early months of the pandemic.
Additionally, 32% of Black Canadians (vs. 24.2% of White Canadians) reported symptoms consistent with
moderate/severe generalized anxiety disorder. Further, 37.5% of Black Canadians (vs. 22.1% of White
Canadians) reported a moderate or severe impact of COVID-19 on their ability to meet financial
obligations or essential needs.
Looking at the underlying socio-economic conditions, data from 2016 indicate that 21% of Black
Canadians reported living in housing below standards, compared to 8% of White Canadians. Moreover,
33% of Black children aged 0-14 and 27% of Black youth aged 15-24 lived in low-income households,
compared to 13% and 12% of White children and youth, respectively.
Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund
Budget 2018 earmarked $42 million to strengthen multiculturalism and address the challenges faced by
Black Canadians, including $10 million over five years for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),
and $9 million over threeyears for Canadian Heritage. These funds are targeted to enhancing local
community supports for youth at risk, and to developing research in support of more culturally-focused
mental health programs in the Black Canadian community.
In September 2018, PHAC launched the Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians
Fund to deliver on the Budget 2018 funding for eight short-term capacity-building projects and fourteen
longer-term implementation projectsall led by Black Canadian experts or organizations. These projects
are expected to be completed by the end of next fiscal year.
We also understand how important it is to share the fundings and best practices from these projects. As
a result, we are also supporting a knowledge mobilization network to contribute to the knowledge and
evidence base, and to share learnings from these innovative projects more broadly. An example of this
work is a project just getting underway and led by TAIBU (pronounced “Tie-boo”), a community health
centre in the Greater Toronto Area that provides programs in a culturally affirming environment. TAIBU
will develop a central space for knowledge sharing that will build capacity within Black communities.
The project will work to improve the awareness of an Afrocentric perspective; and create positive
change in policies and practices that impact the mental health and well-being of Black Canadians.
PHAC has also established the Mental Health of Black Canadians Working Group, comprised of 11 multi-
disciplinary experts in research, practice and policy from diverse Black communities across Canada. The
Working Group played an integral role in the selection of projects for funding and will continue to
provide essential guidance on capacity-building and strengthening evidencegoing forward. PHAC
provides secretariat support to this Working Group.
Other Federal Commitments Supporting Black Canadians
Budget 2019 committed $45 million to Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy and an Anti-Racism Secretariat.
The Strategy’s key purpose isto find ways to counter racism in its various forms, with a strong focus on
community-based projects. Budget 2019 also provided $25 million over five years to Employment and
Social Development Canada for projects and capital assistance to celebrate, shareknowledge and build
capacity in Canada’s vibrant Black Canadian communities. This investment will help stakeholders create
the first national institute for Black Canadians. The Canadian Institute for Persons of African Descent will
work to advance initiatives that impact Black Canadians at a systemic level.
In September 2020, the Government of Canada announced nearly $221 million in funding in partnership
with Canadian financial institutions, including up to nearly $93 million from the Government of Canada
over the next four years to launch Canada’s first-ever Black Entrepreneurship Program. This program will
help Black business owners and entrepreneurs across the country recover from COVID-19 and grow
their businesses.
In December 2020, the Government of Canada announced a new investment of $40 million to create
200 home ownership opportunities across the country for Black Canadians. This is in addition to the
$32.4 million partnership between the Government of Canada and Habitat for Humanity Canada to
create up to 414 new homes across Canada.
In January 2021, the Clerk of the Privy Council issued a Call to Action on Anti-Racism, Equity and
Inclusion in the Federal Public Service. This Call to Action calls on Public Service leaders to advance
employmentopportunities for Indigenous, Black and other racialized employees, particularly with
respect to executive positions and to better foster a safe and positive workplace, free of racism,
discrimination and other barriers.
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research are supporting researchers across the country to develop
and implement measures to rapidly detect, manage, and reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This
includes projects that examine social determinants of health–such as social isolation, stigma, and
racism–and that provide evidence-based interventions to inform social and public health responses.
Race-Based Data and COVID-related Health Inequities
Anti-Black racism underlies a broad range of socioeconomic inequities facing Black Canadians that
contribute to differences in health outcomes. In the context of COVID-19, for example, Black Canadians
and other racialized people are overrepresented in jobsdeemed essential, and are more likely to rely on
public transit to get to these jobs. Experiences of racial discrimination throughout a lifetime can also
directly increase risk for chronic disease, which in turn increases the risk of serious complicationsfrom
COVID-19. There is a need for race-based data to understand and address the disproportionate impact
of COVID-19 on Black Canadians and other racialized communities.
In Canada, race-based health data has not generally been collected due to privacy and confidentiality
concerns. Collection of race-based data is largely a provincial/territorial (P/T) matter, implemented by
local health units. Some P/Ts, including Manitoba and Ontario, are moving forward on efforts to collect
race-based data. Federally,the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health includes a question about
ethnicity/race. Several analyses are planned that will include this variable to further understand the
impact of the pandemic.
PHAC and partners are undertaking a number of activities to improve Canada’s knowledge of the impact
of COVID-19 on racialized communities, including:
• Reviews of the published literature on race and COVID-19;
• Coordinating with federal and P/T governments to include race/ethnicity as a key variable within
the national data set for COVID-19;
• Engaging with various partners to undertake specialized surveys and enhanced surveillance
activities focused on the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 and the pandemic response on key
populations of interest, including racialized populations; and
• Coordinating with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on efforts to facilitate research
activities related to burden and impact of COVID-19 among racialized and marginalized communities, to
further enhance and expand the knowledge base.
Throughout this work, we will continue to prioritize consultation and engagement with Black Canadians
and other racialized communities to inform appropriate data collection, analysis and dissemination
approaches that respect privacy and avoid stigmatization and other potential harms of race-based data
collection.
PHAC, Health Canada and Statistics Canada are exploring opportunities to increase understanding of the
intersection of health, demographic and socio-economic factors in the contextof the pandemic. In
September 2020, PHAC released a new resource entitled “Social determinants and inequities in health
for Black Canadians: A Snapshot”. The Snapshot reports national data on inequalities in health outcomes
and determinants of health forBlack Canadians, and highlights how anti-Black racism and systemic
discrimination are key drivers of health and social inequities faced by diverse Black Canadian
communities.
WELLNESS TOGETHER CANADA
• Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals across the country can access 24/7, virtual
supports ranging from self-assessment, self-guided programming, and peer support, to confidential
online sessions with social workers, psychologists and other professionals.

based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
• A total of $130M was invested in the WTC portal between April 2020 and April 2022.
• Budget 2022 proposes to provide $140 million over two years,starting in 2022-23 so it can
continue to provide Canadians, including health workers with tools and services to support their mental
health and well-being
UTILIZATION
• As of June 6, 2022, over 2.46 million individuals across all provinces and territories have
accessed the portal in over 7.08 million distinct online sessions.
• The new PocketWell mobile app has been downloaded a total of 25,975 times.
• The average costof the WTC portal per user would be around $54 on a per patient/individual
basis (i.e. $130M divided by 2.4M individuals).
• Approximately 39% of site visitors are men, which compared to other services is higher than
usual male engagement.
• Approximately 45% of individuals that have created an account are under the age of 30, an age
group that tends to be underserved by traditional mental health services.

for the portal.
VARIETY OF SUPPORTS
• Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions in over 200 languages and
dialects.
• Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without internet access.
There are dedicated text lines foryouth, adults, and front line workers that provide immediate access to
support.
• There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that can assist with
finding resources on the portal.
MENTAL HEALTH ANDSUBSTANCE USE HUMAN RESOURCES
• The Government of Canada recognizes the incredible contribution that mental health service
providers have made and continue to make to support the mental health and wellness of Canadians.
• The Government of Canada continues to make significant investments to help provincial and
territorial health systems address mental health issues and system capacity. This includes investments
through Budget 2017 that provided $5 billion over 10 years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The establishment of a Canada Mental Health Transfer will build on these agreements to
provide a permanent and ongoing source of funds for mental health services.
• Through Budget 2021, the Government of Canada provided $45 million over two years to
develop national standards for mental health and substance use services, which will provide tools to
support mental health providers in delivering high-quality care.
• We are also working closely with provinces and territories to help address shortages among key
healthcare providers, which includes mental health providers.
IF PRESSED ON NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE WORKFORCE
• The Government of Canada recognizes the heavy toll that COVID-19 continues to have on
Canadians’ mental health andexperiences of substance-related harms, owing in part to increased
isolation, stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness.
• Budget 2021 provided $45 million in funding over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help
develop national standards in order to address Canadians’ needs related to mental health and substance
use; this includes the development of substance use workforce standards.
• National standards will help formalize what Canadians can expect in terms of the timeliness and
quality of services, andaddress stigma related to mental health and substance use. They will provide an
evidence-based framework for service delivery that Canadians can rely on, no matter where they live or
where they access services.
IF PRESSED ON THE BROADERHEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES CRISIS
• COVID-19 has put Canada’s health systems under enormous strain, leading to staffing shortages
and backlogs in services, including for mental health and addictions care.
• That is why, in Budget 2022, the federal government proposedsignificant measures to
strengthen Canada’s health systems. This includes an additional $2 billion to provinces and territories
through the Canada Health Transfer to help provinces and territories address surgeries and procedures,
over and above $4 billioninvested in 2020-21.
• Budget 2022 also announced $115 million over five years, with $30 million ongoing, to expand
the Foreign Credential Recognition Program and help up to 11,000 internationally trained health care
professionals per year get their credentials recognized and find work in their field. It will also support
projects—including standardized national exams, easier access to information, faster timelines, and less
red tape—that will reduce barriers to foreign credential recognitionfor health care professionals.
• As well, the Government of Canada announced $26.2 million to enhance student loan
forgiveness for providers who practice in rural and remote communities and expand the program
beyond physicians and nurses.
• These investments are supporting provinces and territories to reduce shortages in health human
resources ensure to that Canadians have more timely access to the services they need, including mental
health and additions services.
• To further strengthen health care, the federal government is committed to advancing the
priorities of Canadians, with a focus on better access to primary and mental health care, as well as
dental, home, and community care; and the effective use of high quality data and digital systems.
BACKGROUND
A range of different providers offer mental health and addiction services to Canadians, from
psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and other occupations such as counselors and substance
abuse workers. More information is provided below on the labour market conditions for some of these
occupations.
Many Canadians require access to mental health care needs and encounter barriers to do so. In fact,
mental health care needs have been steadily rising throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. According to an
Angus Reid study, 54% of Canadians say their mental health has worsened over the past two years. For
women between the ages of 18 to 54, more than 60% say their mental health has worsened. Polls
conducted by Mental Health Research Canada has found that moreCanadians continue to report high
levels of anxiety and depression (23% and 16%) now than when the pandemic began (5% and 4%), and a
KPMG study found that 42% of Canadians believe the pandemic will have a lasting impact on their
mental health. Further, many health care providers (86.5%) are reporting increased stress related to the
pandemic from the pandemic.
The increased demand for mental health will likely have an impact on the supply of mental health
providers. However, the delivery of care by mental health providers is often complicated by the context
in which mental health care is delivered. Most Canadians will need to pursue mental health services
privately (e.g. employer coverage), and not through publicly insured means. Access to care can be
uneven, and often not sufficient to realize successful outcomes. As such equity issues are prevalent,
with many vulnerable and marginalized populations unable to access and / or afford mental health care.
In an April 2022 submission to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills
and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, the Canadian Psychological
Association (CPA) flags the potential challenges affecting the mental health workforce, especially
psychologists, moving forward from the pandemic. The CPA recommends integrating psychological
services into primary care as a means to make it more accessible to all Canadians. To do so, the CPA
recommends that collaborative primary care teams include a psychologicalhealth human resource to
provide patient-focused services. Such an approach will also alleviate the burden on primary care
physicians and nurse practitioners who may not have the adequate training to provide appropriate
mental health care.
The CPA alsorecommends: 1) accelerating the recruitment, retention, and training of psychologists, 2)
address interprovincial /territorial regulation of health care providers to enable virtual provision of
mental health services; and, 3) more comprehensive data collection on mental health human resources
in both public and private sectors. Such recommendations are aligned with the perspectives of other
health human resource (HHR) stakeholders, and were reflected at the recent HHR Symposium held by
Health Canada in May 2022.
The federal government also supports pan-Canadian health organizations like the Canadian Centre for
Substance use and Addiction and the Mental Health Commission of Canada which play an important role
in developing and supporting the health workforce. For example, to improve the quality of service
delivery, access and supports for people who use substances, CCSA has developed and updated a set of
behavioural and technical competencies for regulated and unregulated professionals working in the
substance use field.
CCSA and MHCC are also working together to explore the development of pan-Canadian operational
guidelines for integrated mental health and substance use service delivery, with the goal of providing
concrete and actionable guidance for theimplementation of an integrated approach for mental health
and substance use.
Federal mental health investments
Wellness Together Canada (WTC)
The WTC portal provides free, credible information and supports available 24/7 to individuals across
Canada inboth official languages to help address their mild to moderate mental health and substance
use issues. It allows Canadians to connect to peer support workers, social workers, psychologists and
other professionals for confidential chat sessions to supporttheir mental health needs.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access tocommunity-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadians can access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health.
Canada Mental Health Transfer
The government is committed to supporting the mental health needs of Canadians. This commitment is
reflected in a suite of existing, pandemic-responseresponse and new initiatives.
With her appointment as the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Minister Bennett is
committed to ensuring that mental health is treated as a full and equal part of the universal healthcare
system. A key way to achieve this objective will be through the establishment of a CanadaMental Health
Transfer (CMHT).
Budget 2022 reaffirmed the intention of engaging provinces and territories on the development of a
CMHT, which would provide a permanent and ongoing source of funding for mental health services.
Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP) (G&C funding for workforce stream)
Budget 2021 invested $116 million, for Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP)
to continue to build up successful community-based programs that can help prevent, treat, and/or
reduce the harms associatedwith opioids, stimulants, alcohol, prescription drugs, and other substances
that have a high risk of problematic use. This included a stream for strengthening the substance use
workforce, which included training or continuing education.
Federal action torespond to the Health Human Resource Crisis
Health Canada, along with other federal departments, has taken an active role in working with provincial
and territorial (PT) governments and key health system stakeholders, such as health care educators, to
identify both immediate and longer-term solutions to address significant health human resources
challenges. The response is also focusing on sustainably increasing the supply of health care workers
and help create healthier workplaces to support retention andthe mental health of health care workers.
Internationally educated health workers and Canada Student Loan Forgiveness
To help bring more workers in the health system, Budget 2022 proposes to provide support for
internationally trained health care professionals to fill these gaps and for doctors working in
underserved rural or remote communities to ensure that Canadians receive the health care they deserve
where they live. This includes:
• $115 million over five years, with $30 million ongoing, to expand the Foreign Credential
Recognition Program and help up to 11,000 internationally trained health care professionals per year get
their credentials recognized and find work in their field. It will also support projects—including
standardized national exams, easier access to information, faster timelines, and less red tape—that will
reduce barriers to foreign credential recognitionfor health care professionals.
• $26.2 million over four years, starting in 2023-24, and $7 million ongoing, to increase the
maximum amount of forgivable Canada Student Loans by 50 per cent. This will mean up to $30,000 in
loan forgiveness for nurses and up to $60,000 in loan forgiveness for doctors working in underserved
rural or remote communities. In addition, the current list ofeligible professionals under the program will
be expanded.
Changes to the Criminal Code
All Canadians, and especially health care workers, deserve a safe working environment, free from
violence and threats. To this end, the Government took action to protect health care workers, through
amendments to the Criminal Code (under the former Bill C-3), in order to ensure health care workers are
safe and free from threats, violence and harassment.
Wellness Together Canada-Targeted supports for health care workers
The Wellness Together Canada portal has specialized supports for frontline workers, which they can
access by texting the word FRONTLINE to the number 741741 for immediate access to support.
Wellness Together Canada has resources available for health care workers, such as:
o MindWell for Healthcare Workers program, a custom mental health training peer support
program designed by healthcare workers for healthcare workers in Canada to help them address stress,
burnout, and mental health (launched in April 2021).
Results haveshown that in just 4 weeks, participants who engaged in the training increased
their levels of mindfulness and resilience while PTSD, exhaustion, and anxiety decreased over time.
MindWell for Healthcare Workers has shown promising results for being an effective online training
program that can readily and cost effectively reach and support thousands of healthcare workers.
o A self-directed program through TogetherAll specific to PTSD.
Labour Market Information
Below are projections on key occupational groups implicated in providing mental health care, according
to the Canadian Occupational Projection System (COPS).
• Psychologists: This occupational group is expected to face labour shortage conditions over the
period of 2019-2028 at the national level. From 2019-2028, the number of job openings for
Psychologists are expected to total 15,700, while the number of job seekers (arising from graduates,
immigration and mobility) is expected to total 13,700. The pandemic has amplified the need for
psychologists for Canadians, including for children and youth who facelong delays for consultations.
• Specialist physicians: This occupational group, which includes psychiatrists, is expected to face
labour shortage conditions over the period of 2019-2028 at the national level. Over the period 2019-
2028, the number of job openings for Specialist physicians are expected to total 32,500, while the
number of job seekers is expected to total 20,000.
• Social workers: shortages in social workers are not anticipated in the short to medium term.
However, growth is expected to slow down later in the projection period of 2019-2028 because demand
for social workers also depends on the level of public spending, and may be limited by the budget
constraints faced by some governments. With regard to labour supply, school leavers are expected to
account for almost 90% of job seekers. This occupational grouping is very popular among school leavers,
which is a reflection of the high enrolment rate in social work programs in colleges anduniversities.
However, an appreciable number of workers are expected to seek opportunities in other occupations,
notably in management occupations in the social and community services sector.
CIHR SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH ON MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTIONS
• Our government continues to recognize the importance of funding innovative and timely
research that will improve health outcomes for people experiencing challenges related to mental health
andsubstance use.
• That is why, over the last five years, throughthe Canadian Institutes of Health Research, we
have invested over $413 million in mental health and behavioural disorders research and over $146
million in research on addictions.
• This includes investments of $13.5 million in the COVID-19 and Mental Health Initiative,
supporting research to provide timely evidence to decision makers on mental health and substance use
responses in the context of COVID-19.
• Additionally, in Budget 2021, we committed $45 million over two years to develop evidence-
informed national mental health service standards.
BACKGROUND
Mental Health
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, CIHR invested over $413 million in mental health and behavioural
disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects led by experts across the country.
For example, CIHR, in partnership with the Graham Boeckh Foundation, is supporting ACCESS Open
Minds, a national project that is transforming the way youth aged 11-25 access mental health care by
developing and testing evidence-informed approaches.There are currently 17 sites operating in 7
provinces and one territory. These sites have transformed youth mental health services in diverse ways
based on local context. For example, in Ulukhaktok, a remote community in the Northwest Territories
where professional service providers are not always available, the site is evaluating a model where lay
health workers are trained to provide support to youth in distress.
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, CIHR invested over $23 million dollars in research related tosuicide
prevention. This research will lead to the discovery of new, effective solutions for better prevention.
In addition, CIHR committed for $6.25M over 5 years to the Mental Health in the Early Years funding
opportunity in March 2022, with a focusarea on mental health initiatives for Indigenous peoples, as well
as transforming mental health with integrated care.
Furthermore, the Integrated Youth Services Network of Networks Initiative ($1M over 1 year), was
launched in April 2022 to create a Canada-wide network of provincial and territorial learning health
systems for Integrated Youth Services for mental health and substance use.
The impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, substance use, and addiction are also being measured,
offering new evidence-based treatments and services to all Canadians. Recent findings identified that
substance use is increasing during COVID-19, and that treatment disruptions can cause relapse,
withdrawal and the restart of risky injection behaviours. While caregivers themselves and older
Canadians require additional supports.
COVID-19 and Mental Health Initiative (CMH)
The mental health of Canadians has worsened during the pandemic. In April 2020, CIHR launched the
CMH initiative to provide timely evidence to decision makers on mental health and substance use
responses in the context of COVID-19. CIHR launched four funding opportunities under this initiative,
supporting a total of 101 projects for a total investment of $13.7M from CIHR and partners, including:
• Rapid synthesis and knowledge-to-action funding opportunity for current evidence on mental
health service needs, delivery and guidelines, practice and related issues, in the COVID-19 context.
• $1M directed grant to the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM) to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providers in light
of COVID-19.
• COVID-19 Mental Health & Substance Use Service Needs and Delivery funding opportunity to
advance research on understanding rapid system transformations, developing innovative adaptations of
services and/or delivery and matching access to service with needs.
• $191K to four CMH grantees to accelerate rapid research related to emerging SARS-CoV-2
variants and generate timelyevidence relevant to biological, clinical, health system, and public health
strategies.
Budget 2021
Highlights with respect to mental health research and services from Budget 2021 include:
• $45 million/2 years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, PHAC, and CIHR to help develop
national mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health
organizations, and key stakeholders.
Substance Use
CIHR supports researchers across Canada that aim to address various issues related to substance use
and has invested more than $146 in the area between 2016-17 and 2020-201.
In 2014, CIHR established a national research network in problematic substance use called the Canadian
Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM). CRISMwas originally composed of four large regional
nodes (British Columbia, Prairies, Ontario, Québec/Atlantic) that connected researchers, service
providers, decision makers and people with lived experience from across Canada. CRISM is recognized as
a critical network that responds to the policy and evidence needs of decision-makers. CRISM activities
include:
• The OPTIMA Study (2016-ongoing)–a national multi-site clinical trial involving over 270
participants recruited from all four CRISM Nodes to compareand evaluate two models of care for the
treatment of opioid use disorder. (~$4.4 million over 4 years).
• National Treatment Guideline–CRISM has developed a National Guideline for the clinical
management of opioid use disorder, which was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal
on March 5, 2018.
• Implementation Research Program–On September 14, 2017, CIHR announced a new
investment of $7.5 million over six years for CRISM to conduct a national research program for effective
implementationof evidence-based interventions into clinical and community.
On April 16, 2021, CIHR launched CRISM Phase II: Regional Nodes funding opportunity. This funding
opportunity represents a total investment of $17M over 6 years, beginning in 2022-2023, and looks to
build and expand on the successes of the Initiative’s first phase by increasing the number of Regional
Nodes to enhance geographic coverage (i.e. creating a new stand-alone node for the Atlantic region)
while maintaining the “Network of Networks” and expanding capacity (including the creation of an
Indigenous Platform and a Coordinating Centre).
In addition to priority-driven investments to CRISM, CIHR also invested $1.5 million to support
evaluation of interventions implemented across Canada in response to the opioid crisis through the
Evaluation of Interventions to Address the Opioid Crisis Funding Opportunity.
In March 2020, CIHR supported 7 projects on methamphetamine and related psychostimulant use,
totaling $700,000. This funding supports research in diverse areas including effectiveness of existing
treatment options, harm reduction strategies, sociocultural impacts of methamphetamine use and
epidemiology of methamphetamine use and associated disorders.
In March 2022, CIHR announced $2M in funding to support 20 one-year catalyst grants on alcohol. These
projects will strengthen the evidencebase and expand alcohol research in key areas, foster alcohol-
related research capacity, and inform the development of future larger scale research projects.
Best Brain Exchange (BBE)
In November 2020, CIHR hosted the ‘Innovations in Virtual Care for Mental Health and Substance Use’
BBE in collaboration with the British Columbia Ministry of Health, British Columbia Ministry of Mental
Health and Addictions, and Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. This BBE brought together
provincial policy and decision makers, researchers and implementation experts, non-governmental
organizations and other key stakeholders to gain an understanding of how virtual care can meet the
unique and evolving mental health and substance use service needs of British Columbia’s diverse
population during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONSIDERATIONS

IF PRESSED ON UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE DRR
• Increased mental health literacy and reduction in stigma have improved knowledge, attitudes,
and help-seeking behavior, contributing to an increased demand for services. This demand has been
compounded during the pandemic with increased levels of anxiety and depression along with a
reduction in available supports.
• Despite progress that may have been achieved, these changes have made it challengingto
reduce unmet mental health needs of Canadians.
• As Minister, I will also work to ensure that mental health care is treated as a full, equal part of
our universal health care system.
IF PRESSED ON THE INTERSECTION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCEUSE RESEARCH (CSCB)
• The Government of Canada recognizes the intersection between mental health and substance
use. Approximately 20% of Canadians with a mental illness have a co-occurring substance use problem,
and approximately 50% of those engaged in treatment for substance use are also living with mental
illness.
• The Canadian Centre for Substance use and Addiction (CCSA) and the Mental Health
Commission of Canada (MHCC) have released a series of public surveys that examine the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use, including on the relationship of substance use
and suicidal ideation.
• The surveys concluded the presence of more mental health symptoms and increased substance
use since March 2020, and that those with a history ofmental health or substance use concerns were
disproportionately impacted by stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amongst the findings were
that more females reported concerns with mental health than males, more males reported problematic
use of substances than females, and more youth reported mental health and substance use concerns
than older generations. The poll also discovered those living alone were more likely to report problems
with depression, suicidal ideation,and problematic substance use.
• In addition, CCSA led a study of healthcare professionals and people who use substances to
better understand their experiences with virtual care in order to inform practice and system change as
we move to implementmore technology-based options.
• The work of the CCSA and MHCC is important to inform public health policy including actions at
the federal and provincial level, and the development of resources related to mental health and
substance use. Mandate Letter commitments, including (but not limited to) advancing a comprehensive
strategy to address problematic substance use, implementing a three-digit suicide prevention line, and
introducing a new fund for student mental health, will help provide targeted supports to those facing
increasingly challenging circumstances brought about as a result of the pandemic.
IF PRESSED ON CANNABIS RESEARCH (CSCB)
• Budget 2018 provided dedicated funding of $10 million over 5 years to the Canadian Centre for
Substance Use and Addiction to advance knowledge on the health, social and safety impacts of
cannabis.
• In collaboration with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and MHCC, CCSA is
providing funding and jointly coordinating research across Canada on priority topics. Findings from their
cannabis research will inform the legislative review of the Cannabis Act.
• CCSA has released various knowledge products and resources in relation to home cultivation
trends and associated risk behaviors in Canada; unintentional pediatric cannabis exposures and youth
interactions with the justice system after legalization of recreational cannabis; and cannabis related
emergency department visits and hospitalizations.
BACKGROUND
Pressure on Existing Provincial/Territorial Mental Health Services
With Canadians physical distancing and isolated, there is an unprecedented need for virtual services,
such as telehealth and other information lines (e.g., 811), and provinces/territories are not able to
absorb the increased demand.
It is critical that Canadians have accessto effective tools to self-monitor, promote their mental well-
being, obtain credible and reliable information, and access services when deemed necessary. Canadians
need to be re-assured that there are supports available to help alleviate their stress, fearand anxiety.
Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services and Address the
Impacts Of COVID-19 On Canadians’ Mental Health
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada invested $130 million from 2020-22 in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal, and received $140 million in Budget 2022 to support the portal
for two more years beginning in 2022-23. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist with finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national service offering support to young peoplevia
phone, text and live chat, and is a global leader in developing and delivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government has allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadians can access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health.
Supportfor the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including health care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and
Métis, and Blackand other racialized Canadians.
• $50 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects to address posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of more than $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As part of this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental HealthPromotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
$9 million is being provided to the United Way (through New Horizons) for practical services for seniors.
The Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund is investing $10 million to support
community-based projects across Canada.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surge in demandduring the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding willsupport the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence
Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $333
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects
led by experts across the country.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative currently supports 101 research projects, representing a total
investment of $13.5 million from CIHR and partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel
composed of leading Canadian experts in mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated
through these projects will be mobilized to ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
CIHR provided the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse with a $1 million directed grant to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providers in light
of COVID-19. This includes the creation of six national guidance documents and a rapid assessment of
the challenges faced by people who use drugs during the COVID-19 crisis to guide future policy
decisions.
Statistics Canada developed and administers a web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. In addition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cycles of
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health to better understand the wider impacts of the
pandemic on mental health in Canada. A special collection of research articles based on thefirst cycle of
data was released in the Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention Journal on September 27,
2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also resumed in September 2020. The Canadian
Community Health Survey provides data on a variety ofmental health indicators, and has been collected
for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for ongoing measurement of changes in mental
health of the Canadian population as the pandemic continues and as Canada recovers.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Associationand Crisis Services Canada. By 2023,
this service will provide people across Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from
trained responders, using the technology of their choice (voice, text or chat). The Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focused on raising public awareness, reducing
stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and evidence-based
practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned
for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the Government of Canada
to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously supported by
parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan that aligns
with the Framework.
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Pursuant to the Federal Framework on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act, Canada’s first Federal
Framework on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was tabled in Parliament on January 22, 2020 and
made public on February 13, 2020. To inform the development of the Framework, in accordance with
the Act, the Minister of Health convened a National Conference on PTSD in April 2019 with the Ministers
of National Defence, Veterans Affairs, and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, partners and
stakeholders, including people with lived-experience. The Government of Canada is now working with
partners on the implementation of the Framework. The Act requires the Public Health Agency of Canada
to report on the effectiveness of the Framework within five years of its release (by February 2025).
HC’s 2020-21 Departmental Results Report
Health Canada advanced the development of national standards for access tomental health services to
gain insight on practical approaches to developing and implementing these standards. As part of this
work, Health Canada has entered into an agreement with the Standards Council of Canada to lead the
development of standards in the following priority areas, in alignment with the Common Statement of
Principles on Shared Health Priorities developed by federal, provincial and territorial governments:
• Children and youth:

MHCC signed a Memorandum of Agreement to work on joint initiatives in this area.
Currently thetwo pan-CanadianHealth Organizations are working on an evidence review on promising
practices, interventions and policy recommendations to screen and assess suicide risk among individuals
with problematic substance use.
They are also exploring the development of pan-Canadian operational guidelines for integrated mental
health and substance use service delivery, with the goal of providing concrete and actionable guidance
for the implementation of an integrated approach for mental health and substance use.

better understanding of wise practices, gaps and opportunities with respect to perinatal mental health
services in Canada.
• On March 9th, 2022, a roundtable was held with a range of different stakeholder groups, to
encompass multiple perspectives, including clinical experts and practitioners, individuals with lived and
living experience, policy-makers and researchers/academics.
• This session will help inform further policy development and stakeholder engagement by the
Health Portfolio as we considers approaches to make progress in this important policy area.
IF PRESSED ON THE STRATEGY IN BILL C-265 (SURVEILLANCE, HEALTH PROMOTION, PREVENTION,
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS)
• PHAC’s Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System monitors and reports on maternal, fetal and
infant health determinants and outcomes whileconducting targeted epidemiological research to
address emerging issues.
• PHAC makes significant investments to support perinatal mental health. In particular, the
Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program provides $26.5 million annually to improve the health ofat-risk
pregnant individuals, with a focus on mental health, nutrition, and the promotion of positive health
behaviours during pregnancy.
• PHAC also supports the development of resources that provide guidance and advice for both
healthcare professionals and individuals that may face poor mental health during the perinatal period.
BACKGROUND
The perinatal period includes both pregnancy and the postpartum period. Perinatal mental health is a
state of well-being in which a pregnant or postpartum person realizes their own abilities, can cope with
the normal stresses of life and work productively, care for themselves and their newborn, and is able to
make a contribution to their community and society.
Perinatal mental illness refers to mental health conditions experienced “around” pregnancy. This
includes pre-existing mental health conditions, but can also refer to new or different mental health
concerns arising around this period.
Maternal stress, anxiety and depression are significant public health issues, increasing the risk of poor
mental and physical health outcomes for mothers along with potential impacts for children and families.
If untreated, consequences include prolonged maternal depression, paternal depression, partner
relationship dissatisfaction and conflict, impaired parent-infant interactions and attachment, risk for
impaired cognitive or psychosocial development for the child (and increased risk of later child
psychopathology) and, in extreme situations, maternal suicide or infanticide. Maternal deaths with a
mental health component, by suicide or drug toxicity, are increasingly recognized as making up a
significant proportion of all maternal deaths.
In recent years, some stakeholders have called for greater federal action in the area of perinatal mental
health. On May 13, 2020, a petition was brought forward to create a national perinatal mental health
strategy that would provide direction, policy, and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive
perinatal mental health care services. Thisincludes universal screening and timely access to treatment
for all people during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
On May 5, 2021 (World Maternal Mental Health Day), various MP’s offices sent a request to the former
Minister of Health’s Office on behalf of their constituents regarding a National Perinatal Mental Health
Strategy. It was brought forward by MP Heather McPherson (Edmonton-Strathcona).
On June 3, 2021, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway) put forward Bill C-306, which calls for a National
Perinatal Mental Health Strategy that includes mental health screening and treatment services during
the full perinatal period. This Bill died on the order paper when Parliament was dissolved in August
2021.
On March 31, 2022, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway) put forward Bill C-265, which again called for
a National Perinatal Mental Health Strategy Act that includes measures to provide perinatal mental
health screening and services and reduce barriers to care, as well as measures to increase perinatal
mental health awareness, training and research.
Perinatal Surveillance
The Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System monitors and
reports on maternal, fetal and infant health determinants and outcomes while conducting targeted
epidemiological research to address emerging issues. This program has focused largely on indicators of
physical health, some of which can be associated with maternal mental health (e.g., fetal/infant
mortality, maternal chronic diseases, smoking, andalcohol use during pregnancy). However, formal
indicators concerning risk and protective factors for maternal mental health have yet to be established,
as there are presently no routine national sources of data on maternal mental health or maternal access
to/use of mental health services.
PHAC Policy and Program Activities
The Health Portfolio undertakes a number of activities to promote maternal and child health, which
includes supporting positive maternal mental health during the perinatal periods. PHACmakes
significant investments to support perinatal mental health through programs aimed at improving
community-level access to supports for prenatal and recently postpartum people, new parents and
young children facing health inequities. In particular, theCanada Prenatal Nutrition Program provides
$26.5 million annually to improve the health of at-risk pregnant individuals, with a focus on mental
health, nutrition, and the promotion of positive health behaviours during pregnancy. Through 236
funded projects, the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program serves more than 45,000 participants across
Canada each year.
PHAC also supports the development of several resources promoting the positive mental health of
pregnant/postpartum individuals. These resources provideguidance and advice for both healthcare
professionals and individuals that may face poor mental health during the perinatal period, including
Family-Centred Maternity and Newborn Care National Guidelines; the Mothers’ Mental Health Toolkit;
and ‘Your Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy’.
To provide rapid support for new parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada and PHAC have
recently developed resources to support the mental health of those who are pregnant or have recently
had a baby.
INTRODUCE A NEW FUND FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH
• Our Government recognizes the significant mental health challenges being faced by post-
secondary students, which have been exacerbated due to COVID-19.
• The federal government is committed to strengthening the mental health and well-being of
post-secondary students and aims to increase comprehensive access to services so that youth [post
secondary students] can get the help they need, when and where they need it.
• The Federal government provides funding to the Mental Health Commission of Canada to
oversee the development, socialization, and implementation of the National Standard of Canada for
Mental Health and Well-Being for Post-Secondary Students (2020).
• We provided $2M to the Canadian MentalHealth Association to pilot a Campus Peer Support
program in five universities that empowers post-secondary students to support each other’s well-being.
• Our Government launched ‘Wellness Together Canada’, an online portal, which provides 24/7
free access for children and youth (ages 5 to 29) to mental health and substance use resources.
• We are investing approximately $100M over 3 years to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted bythe pandemic,
including youth.
• I continue to engage with students, stakeholders and Canadians of all backgrounds, including
individuals with lived and living experience to help raise awareness and advance the government’s
commitment to supporting the mental health and wellbeing of post-secondary students.
IF PRESSED ON SUPPORT FOR INTEGRATED YOUTH SERVICES
• The Government of Canada continues to work with provinces/ territories to help spread and
scale the work on Integrated Youth Services (IYS).
• IYS provide effective, youth-focused and integrated services for mental health, substance use
and related issues, including for youth from priority populations (e.g., LGBTQ2S+, Indigenous, and BIPOC
communities). There are currently 50 operational integrated youth hubs across Canada and a further 60
under development.
BACKGROUND
Why Post-Secondary Student Mental Health:
Three out of four mental health problems begin by age 24, which includes the period when many are
studying at the post-secondary level. Post-secondary students face many challenges including increased
workload, transition into adulthood, living away from home and financial difficulties. The 2019 National
College Health Assessment by the American College Health Association found that52% of post-
secondary students in Canada felt so depressed that it was difficult to function (an increase from 46% in
2016). About 69% reported feeling overwhelmed by anxiety (up four per cent since 2016).
The COVID-19 pandemic has created particular challenges for students, who have been forced to adapt
to remote learning, and have been distanced from personal supports and networks that are typically
commonplace in a post-secondary setting. One year into the pandemic, about 84% of post-secondary
studentsreported that the pandemic has added new, or exacerbated existing, mental health challenges.
Throughout the pandemic, mental health concerns among this group have continued to increase: there
was a noticeable increase in the number of students reporting feeling despair (+16%), overwhelm
(+10%), and sadness (+6%) from the outset of the pandemic to Spring 2021.
Consistent with higher reported incidence of mental health issues, more post-secondary students are
accessing mental health supports during the pandemic compared to before (this is also the case for the
general population). While there is a wide range of supports and services offered at post-secondary
institutions across Canada to promote student mental health and address mental health issues, capacity
for providing comprehensive supports on-campus is limited, which impacts timeliness and accessibility
of services and programs.
Evidence indicate that there is a need for a comprehensive and coordinated mental health plan for post-
secondary students that covers the range of services from prevention to treatment, including peer
support counselling and a range of self-management options (on-line applications, telephone) that can
be accessed 24/7. Research also indicates that increasing mental health literacy and the building of life
skills and resiliency are key to mitigating the high levels of stress during the transition to post-secondary
institutions.
2021 Mandate Letter Commitment:
On October 26, 2021, the Prime Minister appointed Dr. Carolyn Bennett as the First Minister of Mental
Health and Addictions. The Minister’s mandate included a commitment to introduce a new fund for
student mental health that will support the hiring of new mental health care counsellors, improve wait
times for services, increase access overall and enable targeted supports to Black and racialized students
at post-secondary institutions across Canada.”
Government Actions and Investments to Support the Mental Health Needs of Youth:
Funding to the Mental Health Commission of Canada
The Government of Canada provides $14.25 annually to the Mental Health Commission of Canada
(MHCC), which was created in 2007 to act as a catalyst for improving the mental health system in
Canada. The MHCC leads the development and dissemination ofprograms and tools to support the
mental health and wellness of all Canadians by bringing together federal, provincial, and territorial
governments as well as leading mental health organizations.
In 2020, the MHCC developed the National Standard of Canada for Mental Health and Well-Being for
Post-Secondary Students, a set of flexible guidelines to help post-secondary institutions create
environments that foster student mental health and well-being. The Standard can help post-secondary
institutions betterdesign their mental health policies and programs based on evidence, to share
experience and knowledge, while simultaneously improving mental health literacy, building resilience
and addressing student mental health issues before they worsen.
To date,around 47 post-secondary institutions are in the process of implementing the standard with
another 22 preparing for implementation.
Campus Peer Support Pilot
The Government of Canada has also provided $2 million to the Canadian Mental Health Association
(CMHA) toward a three-year Campus Peer Support pilot project. University of Prince Edward Island,
University of New Brunswick, Trent University, Medicine Hat College and the University of British
Columbia were chosen by the CMHA for the pilot, and will workin close partnership with their local
CMHAs, which bring expertise in peer-support programming.
The Campus Peer Support pilot project will empower post-secondary students with the tools they need
to support each other’s well-being. The training material will be created with students, and peer trainers
will be instructed to deliver the curriculum so that the project can continue beyond the pilot phase. The
pilot is aligned with the new National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety for Postsecondary
Institutions.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments and Integrated Youth Services
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services (2017-2027). The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via
negotiated bilateral agreements, informed by the 2017 Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities agreed to by FPT Ministers of Health. In it, Ministers of Health agreed to prioritize
expanded access to community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth as
one of three priorities for the federal funding.
Eleven out of thirteen provinces/territories have identified youth focused initiatives, which could include
integratedyouth services, as part of their bilateral agreement action plans. Three provinces have
specifically identified integrated youth services as part of their action plans.
Integrated Youth Services (IYS) models of care provide locally relevant, effective,youth-focused and
integrated services for mental health/substance use within the community. One example of this model
is the integrated youth hub. These hubs are easily accessible community-based “one stop shops” that
provide an integrated suite of services, which can include peer support, mental health and primary care
support and employment counselling, as well as support for navigating these systems of care. Each hub
leverages existing services so the suite of available services varies by hub. There arecurrently 50
operational integrated youth hubs across Canada and 60 under development.
In addition, nine out of ten provinces have or are developing a provincial networks to implement and
advance the integrated youth services model through the sharing ofbest practices. In some cases, this is
done through the leveraging of a learning health system approach, where data is collected to
continuously inform and improve equitable health outcomes by focusing on practices relating to
equitable access to mental health services. Three of the most established networks are in British
Columbia (Foundry), Ontario (Youth Wellness Hubs Ontario), and Quebec (Aire Ouverte) with BC and
Ontario specifically identifying the use of bilateral funding to support these networks.
Pandemic-Response Initiatives
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada invested $130 million from 2020-2022 in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal, and received $140 million in Budget 2022 to support the portal
for two more years, beginning in 2022-23. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access.
There are dedicated text linesfor youth, adults and front line workers that provide immediate access to
support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that can assist with
finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial and territorial
services, and does not replace them. In January 2022, Wellness Together Canada launched PocketWell,
which is a companion app to the online Portal.
Through the Portal and the app, children and youth (ages 5 to 29) are able to access mental health and
substance use resources, including Kids Help Phone, which provides online, phone and text based
support to young people who are in crisis or dealing with mental health issues.
Additional resources are being invested in Kids Help Phone ($14.8M over 36 months from April 2020 to
March 2023) provide mental health support to youth in need during the pandemic.
As of May 23, over 2.4 million individuals across all provinces and territories have accessed the Wellness
Together Canada portal in over 6.9 million web sessions. The new PocketWell mobile app has been
downloaded a total of 25,731 times. Additionally, over 45% of registered clients of the portal are under
30, an age group that tends to underutilize traditional mental health services.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 announced $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those most
affected by the pandemic, including youth. Funded projects are expected to begin in Spring 2022 and to
reach diverse populations across Canada. Projects will support mental health promotion and mental
illness prevention interventions, in addition to initiatives that build the capacity of service providers to
deliver programming in safe, effective and trauma-informed ways.
ABORIGINAL HEAD START IN URBAN AND NORTHERN COMMUNITIES PROGRAM (AHSUNC)
• The Government of Canada is committed to improving the health and well-being of Indigenous
children and their families.
• Budget 2017 and Budget 2021 provided transformational investments in quality early learning
and childcare for Indigenous families, including support for those living inurban and northern
communities.
• From a public health perspective, funding increases to the AHSUNC program will better address
a number of key social determinants of health, reduce health inequalities, and support the long-term
development of Indigenous children and youth.
BACKGROUND
Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities (AHSUNC)
Socio-economic disparities negatively affect healthy child development. Inparticular, significant
inequalities persist for Indigenous children and families in urban and northern communities. Evidence
indicates that early childhood provides the greatest opportunity to positively influence health and
decrease health and social costs throughout life.
Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities (AHSUNC) currently provides $32.1 million in
annual funding to Indigenous community-based organizations to deliver early intervention programs for
Indigenous children and their families living off-reserve. AHSUNC serves approximately 4,300 Indigenous
children in 133 sites across Canada each year.
Program evaluations indicate the AHSUNC program is having a positive effect on school readiness,
specifically improving children’s language, social, motor and academic skills. Results also indicate
program effectiveness in improving cultural literacy and health promoting behaviours, and improving
access to health services for Indigenous children and their families.
Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care (IELCC)
The Government of Canada is providing up to $1.7 billion over 10 years, starting in 2018-19, to
strengthen early learning and child care programs and services for Indigenous children and families. This
funding will contribute toa comprehensive and coordinated system that is anchored in self-
determination, centred on children and grounded in culture. Employment and Social Development
Canada is leading this horizontal initiative, which includes $34 million in pan-Indigenous funding over
ten years for AHSUNC, with $2.5 million annually for the first four years and $4 million annually in the
following six years.
Through Budget 2021 IELCC funding, AHSUNC is receiving an additional $122.9 million over five years
(2022-23 to 2026-27),with $23.2 million ongoing annually and a 3% escalator beginning in 2027-28. This
funding will support improvements in program delivery at AHSUNC project sites ($80.3 million), as well
as investments to support urgent repairs and renovations at existing sites ($42.6 million).
IELCC Emergency Funding
In support of IELCC programs, the Government announced one time emergency funding of $120 million
in 2020-21 to support the evolving needs of IELCC in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This
included $8.21 million for AHSUNC sites.
The aim of this funding was to preserve the continued availability of AHSUNC programs and services that
many children and families rely on, and to ensure new public health measures can be implemented to
keep children and families safe.
Fall Economic Statement 2020 andBudget 2021
The Fall Economic Statement 2020 committed $2.4 million in program funding and $4 million in ongoing
funding beginning in 2028-29.
DISTINCTIONS-BASED MENTALWELLNESS STRATEGIES
• Mental wellness is a key priority forFirst Nations, Inuit and Métis. We share this priority and
recognize that Indigenous populations in Canada are at a higher risk of experiencing poor mental
wellness than non-Indigenous populations.
• We also acknowledge the profound impact that intergenerational trauma, colonization, the
COVID-19 pandemic and inequities in the social determinants of health have on the mental wellness of
Indigenous populations.
• We remain committed to working closely with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners to support
better access to mental wellness services, including Indigenous-led, distinctions-based, culturally-
relevant and trauma-informed supports.
IF PRESSED ON INVESTMENTS IN INDIGENOUS MENTAL WELLNESS
• The Government of Canada has made significant recent investments to improve mental wellness
in Indigenous communities, with an approximate annual investment of $645 million in 2021-22.
• Budget 2021 announced $597.6 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, for a distinctions-
based mental health and wellnessstrategy with First Nations, Inuit and Métis.
• Budget 2022 will provide $227.6 million over two years, beginning in 2022-23, to maintain
trauma-informed, Indigenous-led, culturally-appropriate services to improve mental wellness,
continuing to implementdistinctions-based mental health and wellness strategies.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORTS TO INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS DURING COVID-19
• In response to the pandemic, our Government moved quickly to create Wellness Together
Canada, providing 24/7access to free and confidential mental healthand substance-use supports.
• Wellness Together Canada continually enhances theportal to ensure inclusivity.
• Phone counselling sessions are supported by instantaneous interpretation in 200 languages and
dialects, including 24 Indigenous languages.
• The portal features contact information for Hope for Wellness (for Indigenous peoples), and
supports populations with barriers to care, including those in isolation or remote areas, facing stigma or
financial difficulties, and official language minority communities.
BACKGROUND
The mandate letters of the Ministers of Mental Health and Addiction and Indigenous Services Canada
include the commitment Services “to co-develop and invest in a distinctions-based MentalHealth and
Wellness Strategy to meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation, including culturally
appropriate wraparound services for addiction and trauma, suicide and life promotion and thebuilding
of treatment centres”.
Improving mentalwellness for First Nations, Inuit and Métis is a key priority for Indigenous leaders,
organizations and communities. This is a priority shared by the Government of Canada. Addressing this
issue is challenging. It needs a holistic, Indigenous-specific, strength-based, distinctions-based,
community-driven approach which supports people, families, and communities. It also needs to address
the legacy of residential schools, the sixties’ scoop, and other devastating impacts of colonization as well
as focus on the social determinants of health such as education, health care, culture, language, and self-
determination.
The Government of Canada has made significant recent investments to improve mental wellness in
Indigenous communities, including an approximate annual investment of $645 million in 2021-22
through Indigenous Services Canada’s Mental Wellness Program. These investments are made to meet
the immediate mental wellness needs of communities by supporting Indigenous-led suicide prevention,
life promotion andcrisis response, including through crisis line intervention services, and enhancing the
delivery of culturally-appropriate substance use treatment and prevention services in Indigenous
communities. This funding also supports the provision of essential cultural, emotional, and mental
health support to former Indian Residential School and federal Day School students and their families as
well as those affected by the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.
Part of these recent investmentsinclude funding specific to distinctions-based approaches to mental
wellness services, including investments through Budget 2021 of $597.6 million over three years, and
$227.6 million over two years in Budget 2022. A further $107M was announced in August 2021 for
trauma informed health services in response to the confirmation of unmarked burials at Residential
Schools.
The Government of Canada works closely with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners to improve mental
wellness for Indigenous populations in Canada. While collaborations with First Nations and Inuit on
mental wellness at national, regional and community levels is long-standing, partnerships with Métis
have only recently been initiated as a result of new funding through Budget 2021. Previous to Budget
2021, the only Métis specific funding for mental wellness was a result of an investment of $82.5 million
announced in August 2020 to support First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities in adapting services to
meet mental wellness needs resulting from the pandemic.
Indigenous Services Canada is guided by three key Indigenous-led mental wellness strategies, namely
the First Nations Mental Wellness Continuum Framework, Honouring Our Strengths and the National
Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy. These documents outline a holistic approach to mental wellness that is
grounded in culture and Indigenous-specific determinants of health.
First Nations leaders, partners and communities see the First Nations Mental Wellness Continuum
Framework and Honouring OurStrengths as the key strategies for First Nations mental wellness.
Similarly, Inuit leaders, partners and communities see the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy as
the key strategy for Inuit mental wellness. Implementation of these distinctions-based strategies is an
essential priority for partners to make progress on distinctions-based approaches to improving mental
wellness among First Nations and Inuit. There is currently no Métis-specific strategy for mental wellness.
The Government of Canada recognizes that the COVID 19 pandemic is having profound impacts on
mental wellness in Indigenous communities by magnifying existing mental health issues and inequities
and creating new gaps and needs. This is a key priority for the Government of Canada. Many mental
wellness services continue to be accessible with some experiencing breaks in service, shifts in service
delivery, or new innovative approaches to reach community members. The Minister of Indigenous
Services Canada announced an investment of $82.5Min August 2020 to help Indigenous communities
adapt and expand mental wellness services, improving access and addressing growing demand, in the
context of the pandemic.

services, and to develop First Nations led solutions that place the well being of children first.
BACKGROUND
On December 31, 2021, two Agreements-in-Principle were reached between Canada, the Assembly of
First Nations, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, the Chiefs of Ontario, the Nishnawbe
Aski Nation and counsels for the AFN-Moushoom and Trout class actions (collectively, “the Parties”).
One agreement in principle is for compensation for those harmed by discriminatory underfunding of
First Nations child and family services and for those who were denied, or delayed in receiving, services
under Jordan’s Principle and the other pertains to the long-term reform of the First Nations Child and
Family Services Program.
These Agreements-in-Principle provide a basis for final settlement agreements to be negotiated over the
coming months. The Agreements-in-Principle include:
• $20 billion in compensation for First Nations children on-reserve and in the Yukon, who were
removed from their homes between April 1, 1991 and March 31, 2022, and for their parents and
caregivers. This also includes compensation for those impacted by the government's narrow definition
of Jordan's Principle between December 12, 2007 and November 2, 2017, as well as for children who did
not receive or were delayed receiving an essential public service or product between April 1, 1991 and
December 11, 2007. Our shared goal is to achieve a settlement that can be delivered to families as soon
as possible.
• Approximately $20 billion, over five years, for long-term reform of the First Nations Child and
Family Services program to ensure that the discrimination found by the CHRT never repeats itself. This
includes funding to support young First Nations adults aging out of the child welfare system and
prevention services to build on the multi-generational cultural strengths to help children and families in
staying together that will be implemented as early as April2022. There is also new funding for on-
reserve housing to support these prevention initiatives.
The Parties will continue to work together to reach final settlement agreements on both compensation
and long-term reform of the First Nations Child and Family Services program. These agreements would
support future work on reforms of Jordan's Principle and other initiatives by Indigenous Services
Canada. This process will unfold over the course of 2022.
The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Orders on Capital
On November 16, 2021, the CHRT issued 2021 CHRT 41. This decision contains orders for Canada to fund
the purchase and construction of capital assets for the delivery of First Nations child and family services
or for the delivery of services under Jordan'sPrinciple on reserve. This includes funding to conduct
capital needs and feasibility studies.
Following the submission of a consent motion from Canada and the parties, on January 18, 2022, the
CHRT amended the orders in the decision of November 16, 2021.
Recent case in Ontario region
A CBC article from January 15, 2022, indicated concerns from speech-language pathologists in the
Ontario region who said their clients are experiencing payment delays from Jordan's Principle.
• Bright Spot Therapy Services,Ont., suspended services for 22 First Nations children due to
payment delays.
• 69% of invoices submitted to ISC by Bright Spot Therapy Services have been paid, and 31%
remain outstanding.
ADVANCING RECONCILIATION IN CANADA’S HEALTH SYSTEMS
• Thefederal government is committed to take action to foster health systems free from barriers,
including racism and discrimination.
• Through Budget 2021, the Government is investing funding to support Indigenous and health
system partners in the developmentof measures to address anti-Indigenous racism in Canada’s health
systems. This includes support for activities such as cultural safety and humility training, tools and
resources for health professionals, and standards and guidelines for safe and inclusivecare.
• The Government of Canada acknowledges that Indigenous Peoples are best placed to determine
and address their health care needs. This investment will ensure that First Nations, Inuit and Métis
Peoples are engaged in actions to foster health systemsfree from racism and discrimination, where
Indigenous Peoples are respected and safe and will support Indigenous partners to undertake
meaningful engagement on their health priorities.
IF PRESSED
• Health Canada continues to work with Indigenous and health system partners to identify and
support Indigenous-led solutions to eliminate anti-Indigenous racism across Canada’s health systems.
BACKGROUND
In September 2020, the death of Joyce Echaquan, an Atikamekw woman from Manawan, Quebec,
sparkedwidespread indignation, media attention, a public coroner’s inquest, and a lawsuit from
Echaquan's family against the hospital where she suffered racist insults from hospital staff before she
died in Joliette, QC. On November 16th, 2020, the Manawan Atikamekw Council and the Council of the
Atikamekw Nation submitted Joyce’s Principle to the Prime Minister, as well as to federal, provincial,
and territorial ministers, which demands that all Indigenous Peoples have an equal right to the highest
standard of physical and mental health, with a right to traditional medicines.
In response to Joyce Echaquan’s death, Ministers of Health, Indigenous Services, Crown-Indigenous
Relations, and Northern Affairs held three National Dialogues on October 16th, 2020, January27-28th,
2021, and June 28-29th, 2021, to listen to Indigenous Peoples and health service providers regarding
their lived experiences with racism, to provide federal, provincial, and territorial governments and
health system partners a platform to presenttheir past, ongoing, and planned actions to address anti-
Indigenous racism in the health systems, and to hear recommendations from Indigenous and health
system partners.
At the January National Dialogue, the Minister of Health announced $4M in funding to establish the
National Consortium of Indigenous Medical Education to implement Indigenous-led work streams that
will transform Indigenous medical education and contribute to the delivery of culturally safe care. The
Minister of Indigenous Services also announced plans to begin co-developing distinctions-based
Indigenous health legislation and funding of $2M to the Atikamekw Nation and Manawan First Nation to
implement Joyce’s Principle.
Following the January National Dialogue, FPT leaders released a joint statement to express a collective
commitment to working with Indigenous communities, organizations, and leadership to address
Indigenous-specific racism in the health systems.
The June National Dialogue included breakout sessions where recommendationswere heard from
Indigenous and health system partners on the following thematic areas: increasing Indigenous
representation in postsecondary health education, cultural safety and humility, traditional approaches
to health, and safe patient navigation. During the meeting, the Government of Canada released the
Federal Response to the National Dialogues, including publicly announcing funding for specific initiatives
to address anti-Indigenous racism in Canada’s health systems, including Health Canada’s new Addressing
Racism and Discrimination in Canada’s Health Systems Program.
While the federal government is working with Indigenous partners on a number of health policy
initiatives, dedicated work must be undertaken to directly address anti-Indigenous racismin the health
systems. The Government has committed to responding to a number of high profile reports and
recommendations to address anti-racism, cultural safety, and safe and equitable care, including the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women and Girls’ Calls for Justice, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples. In addition, there are class action lawsuits on forced and coerced sterilization of
Indigenous women in multiple jurisdictions, and both the House of Commons Standing Committee on
Health and the Senate Committee on Human Rights have undertaken studies on this issue.
Health Canada’s New Funding Program
Budget 2021 announced $126.7 millionover three years, beginning in 2021-22, for Indigenous Services
Canada and Health Canada to take action to foster health systems free from racism and discrimination
where Indigenous Peoples are respected and safe. Prior to this investment, there was no federal funding
available to specifically address anti-Indigenous racism in the health systems.
Health Canada received $14.9 million over three years to establish the new Addressing Racism and
Discrimination in Canada’s Health Systems Program. The Program’s inaugural Call for Proposals closed
on May 25, 2022. Funding announcements are expected in fall/winter 2022-23.
The Government’s commitment to engage with Indigenous Peoples has placed a heavy burden on
Indigenous organizations who may not have the capacity to participate in the multiple engagement
requests from the federal government, including Health Canada. Health Canada’s new Program will also
support Indigenous communities and organizations to build capacity to engage on their health priorities.

BACKGROUND
The Family Violence Prevention Program
The goal of the Indigenous Services Canada's Family Violence Prevention Program is to improve the
safety and security of Indigenous women, children, families, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people.
The Family Violence Prevention Program provides fundingfor the following components:
• day-to-day operations of emergency shelters and transitional (second stage) housing that
provide services for Indigenous women, children, families, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people across Canada,
including in the North and in urban centres;
• support for shelter capacity;
• engagement and community prevention projects to raise awareness specific to Métis women,
girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people; and
• culturally-appropriate prevention projects on and off reserve, such as public awareness
campaigns, stress and anger management support groups, and community needs assessments.
On May 29, 2020, funding of $44.8 million over five years was announced to build 12 new shelters: 10
shelters for First Nations communities across the country, and two in the territories. The government
will also provide $40.8 million to support operational costs for these new shelters over the first five
years, and then$10.2 million annually ongoing.
In response to the Expression of Interest for the Shelter Initiative, 69 proposals were received by the
deadline of January 15, 2021. On June 17, 2021, both Ministers jointly announced the location of the 12
new shelters for Indigenous peoples seeking to escape family violence. The approved shelters are
intended to be Indigenous-led and seek to provide vital refuge as well as critical supports and services to
help survivors of family violence recover from the trauma of their experiences. The shelters will be built
in partnership with the following communities:
• Lil'wat Nation, British Columbia
• Sturgeon Lake Cree Nation, Alberta
• Whitefish Lake First Nation #459, Alberta
• Prince Albert Grand Council, Saskatchewan
• Keeseekoowenin, Manitoba
• Hollow Water, Manitoba
• Wasauksing First Nation, Ontario
• Odanak First Nation, Quebec
• Natoaganag (Eel Ground) First Nation, New Brunswick
• Acadia First Nation, Nova Scotia
• Council of Yukon First Nations, Yukon
• Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, Northwest Territories
This funding is in addition to the $10 million previously announced inCOVID-19 supports for First
Nations shelters in 2020-2021 and to the $1 million per year ongoing to engage Métis leaders and
service providers on assessing shelter needs and community-led violence prevention projects for Métis
women, girls, 2SLGBTQQIA+ People.
On November 30, 2020, the Fall Economic Statement announced $724.1 million to launch a
Comprehensive Violence Prevention Strategy to expand access to a continuum of culturally relevant
supports for Indigenous women, children and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people facing gender based violence. This
strategy will support new shelters and transition housing for First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples
across the country, including on reserve, and in the North and in urban areas. This is a joint initiative
delivered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation which is responsible for the construction of the
new shelters and transition homes, and Indigenous Services Canada, which provides operational
funding.
On January 26, 2021, the Minister of Indigenous Services , the Honourable Marc Miller along with
Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, committed to fund
the construction and operations of shelters for Inuit women and children across Inuit Nunangat as well
as in urban centres. Thefunding for the new shelters is part of the funding announced in the 2020 Fall
Economic Statement for the comprehensive Violence Prevention Strategy. In August 2021, the Call for
Proposals for the Shelter Initiative for Inuit Women and Children was launched by Pauktuutit Inuit
Women of Canada, in collaboration with Indigenous Services Canada and Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corporation. In November 2021, the Shelter Initiative for Indigenous Women and Children was
launched by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, in collaboration with Indigenous Services
Canada.
SUBSTANCE USE IN YOUTH
• Protecting the health and safety of youth is a top priority for the Government of Canada.
• The Government of Canada has invested in prevention campaigns to inform youth and young
adults on the risks and harms of substance use, to provide guidance to reduce those harms, and to
reduce substance-use stigma.
• Our comprehensive evidence-based approach to prevention helps communities promote
protective factorsin order to create healthy, supportive environments and build resiliency among youth,
to prevent substance use-related harms.
IF PRESSED ON THE FEDERAL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING SUBSTANCE USE
• The Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy (CDSS) guides federal actions on substance use.
• It takes a public health approach for all substances, aiming to protect the health and safety of
Canadians from substance use-related harms.
• The Strategy focuses on reducing rates of use and preventing substance use-relatedharms,
especially for youth and at-risk populations, as well as harm reduction, treatment and enforcement.
• The federal government is updating the CDSS to reflect expert advice, public consultations and
evidence-based actions to address substance use related harms, including youth.
IF PRESSED ON PREVENTION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORTS
• The federal government is focused on preventing substance use among youth by providing
accurate and trusted information to help youth make informed choices.
• The federal government provides funding to community-based programs through the Substance
Use and Addictions Program (SUAP). SUAP funds projects that address root causes, prevent harms, or
provide services that can help avoid future risks of substance use.
• The Government of Canada supports interventions that build resilience and other protective
factors among youth while minimizing risk factors. This includes supporting community capacity building
and developing school-based resources.
IFPRESSED ON CANNABIS
• Consumption patterns among youth have not changed significantly since the enactment of the
Cannabis Act.
• The Government of Canada invested in public education prior to legalization and regulation with
campaigns to educate youth and young adults, and promoting informed decision-making, education on
the health risks of cannabis, and road safety.
• In spring 2022, Health Canada launched the revamped teacher-led “Pursue Your Passion”
campaign for youth 13-15.
• The Cannabis regime includes provisions to reduce the appeal of cannabis to youth, including
strict promotion restrictions, child-resistant plain packaging, and THC limits in specific products.
IF PRESSED ON ACCIDENTAL INGESTION OF ILLEGAL CANNABISEDIBLES IN CHILDREN
• In December 2021, Health Canada released an updated advisory to warn Canadians about the
risks of children consuming illegal cannabis products designed to resemble popular candies and snacks.
• Health Canada continues work with several partners to monitorand address this issue (Canadian
Surveillance System for Poison Information, Public Safety, RCMP, etc.).
• Health Canada will continue to raise awareness of this issue, including sharing information on
how to identify legal products and suppliers, reading and interpreting labels on cannabis products and
safe storage practices.
IF PRESSED ON ILLEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS TARGETED AT YOUTH
• The Cannabis Act includes requirements to protect youth from the risks of cannabis. These
include restrictions on promotion; prohibiting products and packaging appealing to youth; and THC
limits in specific products.
• Illegal cannabis products have no controls, and are riskier. The products often mimic common
snacks and candy, and may contain dangerous contaminants or highTHC.
• The Act gives law enforcement tools to crackdown on illegal sales, including those targeting
youth.
• Health Canada is running a campaign to help Canadians understand the risks of illegal cannabis,
and recognize the difference between legal and illicit cannabis.
IF PRESSED ON ARE HIGH CONCENTRATIONVAPE PRODUCTS LEGAL
• Vape pens use cannabis extracts which are limited to 1000mg of THC per immediate container
and concentrations as high as 85% can be found in the legal market. Legal products are subject to the
strict requirements of the Cannabis Act which are designed to protect Canadians and youth.
• The illegal market also produces high concentration products that are sold in packaging
appealing to youth.
• Anyone who suspects illegal activity should immediately contact their local law, or municipal by-
law enforcement authority.
IF PRESSED ON WHAT HEALTH CANADA IS DOING TO COMBAT ILLEGAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS
TARGETING YOUTH
• Health Canada supports efforts against illegal cannabis products targeted at youth by raising
awareness and is currently conducting a public awareness campaign to help Canadians recognize the
difference between legal and illicit cannabis and only purchase legal cannabis.
• Public Safety also works closely with law enforcementand border officials to combat the illegal
market.
IF PRESSED ON TOBACCO USE
• Canada’s Tobacco Strategy is a comprehensive and integrated approach to increase cessation
rates and protect youth and non-smokers from nicotine addiction, supported by a $330M investment
over five years, starting in May 2018.
• Health Canada is updatingthe labelling requirements to reflect the latest scientific evidence. We
will continue to strengthen regulations to prevent youth and non-smokers from becoming addicted and
to provide Canadians with health information on tobacco use.
IF PRESSED ON OPIOIDUSE AMONG YOUTH
• The Government of Canada recognizes that the opioid overdose crisis is one of the most serious
public health threats in Canada.
• To support awareness, the Know More Tour, launched in 2018, engages with teens and young
adults on the health risks associated with opioid use, as well as the harms of substance-use stigma.
• The Government of Canada remains committed to leading a whole-of-society approach to
address the opioid overdose crisis. Our approach seeks to ensure that all Canadians can access the life-
saving substance use and health supports they need.
IF PRESSED ON ALCOHOL
• The Government of Canada recognizes that alcohol use has health and social consequences for
individuals and communities across Canada, especially youth.
• In May 2019, Health Canada introduced regulations restricting the amount of alcohol in single-
serving flavoured alcoholic beverages to protect Canadians, in particular youth, from the risks, including
unintentional overconsumption and alcohol poisoning.
• To better inform the public about the harms of alcohol, we will be updating Canada’s Low-Risk
Drinking Guidelines by the end of 2022. This will provide Canadians with the most accurate and up-to-
date advice on lower-risk alcohol use.
IF PRESSED ON PAIN MANAGEMENT FOR CHILDREN
• The government recognizes the unique challenges faced by children living with ongoing pain.
• In 2019, the federal government invested $1.6 million to establish the Solutions for Kids in Pain
Network, or SKIP, to help bridge the gapbetween current treatment practices and available evidence-
based solutions for children's pain.
• Health Canada is committed to continuing to work with key partners, including SKIP, to support
actions to enhance knowledge and disseminate information related to best practices, so that the needs
of children living with chronic pain are better addressed.
BACKGROUND
Overview: Substance Use-Related Harms Among Youth
Relative to adults, youth are more vulnerable to substance-related harms for a variety of reasons. For
example, youth are typically physically smaller than adults, which can impact the amount of substances
that their bodies can handle. Further, substance use before or during sensitive periods in brain
development can affect brain structure and volume, with negative effects on higher brain function and
impulse control. This is in part why adolescence is a critical at-risk period for substance use disorders. In
addition, adolescence and young adulthood is a time of major social and emotional development;
regular substance use during these years can truncate this learning. The earlier and more frequent the
exposure to substances, the greater the risk of these harms.
Mental health and substance use problems are common among youth. 7 in 10 children andyouth aged
10-24 hospitalized for harm caused by substance use also have a mental health condition.
Polysubstance use most often refers to the intentional use of multiple substances either together, or in
close proximity with one another. Evidence priorto the pandemic suggested that polysubstance use was
on the rise among substance-using Canadian youth, and remains of particular concern for males and
Indigenous youth.
Substance-Specific Harms and Trends (see end of note for further details on rates ofuse)
The top three substances used by youth and young adults are cannabis, tobacco and alcohol products.
(See separate HESA note related to Youth and Vaping).
Cannabis:
According to the 2021 Canadian Cannabis Survey, past 12-month use of cannabis for non-medical
purposes has increased among Canadians aged 16 years and over, from 22% in 2018 to 25% in 2021.
Tobacco:
Nicotine exposure impacts the developing brain, and youth can become dependent at lower levels than
adults.
The 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) show the largest annual smoking decline in the
survey’s history, decreasing from 4.7M to 4.2M Canadians 12 years of age and older. Decades of tobacco
control have seen positive impacts, resulting in the decline in use among youth.
Alcohol:
According to the CSTADS, alcohol is the substance with the highest prevalence of use by Canadian
students in grades 7 to 12.
Excessive and risky drinking can impact youth in many ways. Some direct harms associated with alcohol
over-consumption includeinjury, memory loss, sexual coercion and assaults, suicide and other forms of
self-harm, alcohol toxicity and motor vehicle crashes. Long-term harms include substance use disorders,
learning and memory issues, problems with school performance, increased risk of school dropout, and
increased risk for certain chronic diseases.
Federal Actions targeted at substance use among children and youth:
The federal government provides funding to support community-based programs through the Substance
Use and Addictions Program (SUAP). Under prevention, health promotion and early intervention, SUAP
funds projects that aim to address the root causes of harmful substance use, prevent the harms
associated with substance use, or provide services that can help to avoid future risks.
• As part of Health Canada’s national naloxone training and distribution program, SUAP has
committed $2.6 million over 3 years for the Advanced Coronary Treatment Foundation (or ACT) in order
to provide overdose response training in high schoolsacross the country to prepare young people for
emergencies they may encounter at home and in the community.
• A youth services organization, The Foundry, in Vancouver, in conjunction with Providence
Health Care, is receiving nearly $1.9 million over five years through SUAP to develop better evidence
and tools to screen, treat and provide long-term support for youth with substance use problems,
particularly opioids, cannabis and alcohol.
• Six Nations of the Grand River in Ohsweken Ontario is receiving over$820,000 over two years to
share culturally appropriate public education on cannabis use to help youth and young adult community
members make informed decisions through community engagement, educational information, and
other tools which will also be shared with other First Nations, schools, and healthcare providers across
Canada.
The Government of Canada is investing in substance use prevention research to support the
development of evidence-based interventions. For example, in 2017, Canadian Institutesof Health
Research (CIHR) invested $1.8 million over five years to support the Canadian Underage Substance Use
Prevention (CUSP) trial. The CUSP trial is generating evidence to inform effective prevention services
that are tailored for youth. The CUSP trial is evaluating the implementation and scale-up of school-based
interventions in order to prevent illicit substance use among high-risk youth.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) engages with partners and stakeholders to mobilize
knowledge on bestpractices for preventing substance-related harms in youth. This includes supporting
communities in building capacity to adapt and implement approaches to upstream prevention that
enhance protective factors and minimize risk factors among youth.
In 2021, PHAC released the Blueprint for Action: Preventing substance-related harms among youth
through a Comprehensive School Health approach, a resource that combines evidence-based
approaches (harm reduction, upstream prevention, equity-oriented interventions, and stigma reduction)
with an internationally recognized framework for building healthy school communities. The Blueprint’s
comprehensive focus stems from evidence that “traditional” approaches for addressing substance use in
school contexts (e.g.,abstinence-only framing, focus on negative health impacts, etc.) is ineffective at
preventing substance use or its related harms, in part since they do not reflect the contexts and needs of
many youth. PHAC also supported development of educational toolsand workshops to help school
community members implement the Blueprint for Action in their respective contexts.
The federal government is starting to review communications, public education and prevention material
to determine how they can integrate multiple substances as opposed to taking a substance-specific
approach.
Actions specific to Cannabis:
The Government of Canada has invested in cannabis public education over the past several years, since
before legalization and regulation.
• In Budget 2017,the Government invested $46 million over five years to support public
education, awareness and surveillance activities. In Budget 2018, the Government invested another
$62.5 million over five years to support the involvement of community-based organizations and
Indigenous organizations that are educating their communities on the risks associated with cannabis
use.
• Many projects and campaigns largely focus on educating youth and young adults, including:
promoting informed decision-making; education on thehealth risks of cannabis including the impact on
mental health; health promotion; harm reduction; and road safety. For example, Operation Springboard
has delivered their “Weed out the Risk” educational program on the health and road safety risks of
driving while under the influence of cannabis in high schools across the country focusing on harm
reduction. The Boys and Girls Club has also developed and delivered a health-promotion and
prevention-focused educational and awareness program to youth about substance use, addictions and
mental health.
• In spring 2021, Health Canada launched a digital advertising campaign aimed at youth and
young adults under the age of 25. This campaign highlighted the mental health risks associated with
cannabis use, highlighting the risk posed to brains which are still under development.
• In spring 2022, Health Canada launched the revamped “Pursue Your Passion” campaign. This
iteration is a teacher-led classroom lesson aimed at youth aged 13-15 and focuses on the mental and
physical health risks associated with cannabis use.
Action Specific to Alcohol:
The Government of Canada is committed to addressing alcohol-related harms by supporting research to
inform health policies and interventions on alcohol; funding innovative, community-based approaches
to address alcohol use that focus on harm reduction, treatment, and prevention; supporting public
education for targeted audiences and closely monitoring trends in alcohol consumption and alcohol-
related harms in Canada.
Rates ofSubstance Use Among Youth
Cannabis:
Consumption patterns have not changed significantly, since the enactment of the Cannabis Act:
• According to the 2021 Canadian Cannabis Survey, past 12-month use of cannabis for non-
medical purposes (i.e. using cannabis at least once in the past year) has increased among Canadians
aged 16 years and over, from 22% in 2018 to 25% in 2021), though high risk behaviours like daily/almost
daily use and problematic use have not increased.
o Past 12-month use of cannabis for non-medical purposes has decreased 7% (from 44% in 2021
to 37% in 2021) among individuals aged 16-19 years but remained stable overall from 2018 to 2021.
o The Canadian Student Tobacco Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS) reported that the prevalence
of past-year cannabis (~18%) use among students in grade 7 to 12 has not significantly changed between
2014/2015 and 2018/2019.
o Additionally, according to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) which captures data
on cannabis use among Canadian youth 12 years of age and older, the prevalence of past-year cannabis
use also remained stable between 2019 (24%) and 2020 (23%) among 15 to 19 year olds.
• The average age of initiation of cannabis use continues to increase over time, rising from 18.9
years in 2018 to20.4 years in 2021.
Tobacco:
• Data released on September 8, 2021, from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS),
show the largest annual smoking decline in the survey’s history, decreasing from 4.7M to 4.2M
Canadians 12 years of age and older. Decades of tobacco control have seen positive impacts, resulting in
a national average rate of 13% (4.2M) down from 15% (4.7M) in 2019. Daily smoking also declined to 9%
(2.9M) from 10% (3.2M) in 2019. A reliable estimate on daily smoking for youth aged 15-19 cannot be
determined for 2020. Daily smoking for youth aged 12-17 is less than 1% (10,300).
Opioids:
• Tragically, the most recent data indicates that 26,690 apparent opioid toxicity deaths occurred
in Canada between January 2016 and September 2021, with approximately 1-2% of these deaths
occurring in children and youth.
• In addition, for the first nine months of 2021 in Canada, 4% of the 3,180 accidental opioid-
related poisoning hospitalizations were among the 0-19 age group.
Alcohol:
• According to the CSTADS, alcohol is the substance with the highest prevalence of use by
Canadian students in grades 7 to 12.
• After decreasing through successive cycles of the survey (from 53% in 2008-09), the prevalence
of use of alcohol in the past 12months by students remained at 44% (approximately 880,000) in 2018-
19, unchanged from 2016-17. Females were slightly more likely than males to report past 12-months use
(45% vs. 43%). Grade 10-12 students were much more likely than grade 7-9 students to report past 12-
months use (64% vs 25%). Grade 10-12 students were much more likely than grade 7-9 students to
report past 12-months use (64% vs 25%).
• Less than one quarter of students (23%, approximately 481,000) reported high risk drinking
behaviour (i.e., five or more drinks on one occasion) in the past 12 months, which was unchanged from
2016-17. Females and males reported similar past 12 months prevalence of high-risk drinking. Grade 10-
12 students were much more likely than grade 7-9 students to reporthigh-risk drinking (38% vs 9%).
Chronic Pain:
• It is estimated that one in five children and youth experience ongoing pain.
• Children with pain have unique needs and when their pain goes unmanaged, it is associated
with poor academic, social, and developmental outcomes, including higher rates of chronic pain,
substance use, and mental health issues in adulthood.
• The Canadian Pain Task Force made a number of recommendations to enhance knowledge and
support the adoption of best practices to address thespecific needs of children and youth living with
pain.
• Health Canada is currently working with pain stakeholders, including the Solutions for Kids in
Pain Network to address some of the Task Force recommendations.
Other Substances:
According to the CSTADS 2018-2019 cycle:
• Past-12-month use of hallucinogens was reported by 3% of students (approximately 73,000),
unchanged from 2016-17. Use of other illicit drugs remained relatively low (under 2%).
• In 2018-19, the prevalence of past-12-month use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals to get high
increased to 7% (approximately 137,000 students) from 6% in 2016-17. Psychoactive pharmaceuticals
include sedatives/tranquilizers, stimulants and prescription pain relievers.
• In 2018-19, the prevalence of past-12-month dextromethorphan use to get high among students
in grades 7 to 12 increased to 6% (approximately 126,000) from 5% in 2016-17. Past-12-month use of
Gravol® to get high also increased to 5% (approximately 101,000 students) in 2018-19 from 4% in 2016-
17.The use of sleeping medication available from a drugstore (such as Nytol® or Unisom®) to get high
remained unchanged at 4% (approximately 84,000 students) in 2018-19.
FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER ANDIMPACTS OF COVID-19
• The Government of Canada is continuing to advance action on FASD awareness, prevention,
diagnosis, and intervention. This work is especially relevant given evidence that some Canadians have
increased their alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemicand the impacts this may have on
pregnancy and FASD.
• To date, the Government of Canada has supported efforts across Canada to guide action on
FASD through the FASD National Strategic Projects Fund (NSPF). The Fund allocates $1.5 million annually
for projects that promote education and awareness; harm reduction approaches for those at high risk of
having a child exposed to alcohol and other substances during pregnancy; and research into the social
determinants of health that impact alcohol consumption and FASD. NSPF will undergo an evaluation by
the Office of Audit and Evaluation later this year, and findingswill guide next steps on FASD.
• The Government of Canada is continuing to explore options to address existing knowledge gaps
regarding national prevalence estimates of FASD in Canada, and in particular among key populations
such as Indigenous peoples. Two recommendations in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of
Canada’s Calls to Action (#33 and #34) focus on FASD, calling for culturally appropriate preventive
programs and criminal justice system reform.
• The Government of Canada promotes healthy pregnancies, including FASD awareness and
prevention, by (1): supporting evidence-based policy and guidance for health practitioners and the
general public on prenatal issues, such as Your Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy for expectant parents; and
(2) investing in community-based programs to promote the health of pregnant people, young children
and families facing barriers to health equity, including the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program and the
Community Action Program for Children.
BACKGROUND
FASD is a diagnostic term used to describe the impact on the brain and body of individuals prenatally
exposed to alcohol. It is a lifelong disability and people with FASD will experience some degree of
challenges with their motor skills, physical health, learning, memory, attention, emotional regulation,
and social skills. The number of people with the disorder is unknown. Recent studies from Canada, the
US and Europe estimate that 1% to 5% of the population have the disorder.
A 2013 cost-of-illness study examined the impact of FASD on the material welfare of Canadian society by
analyzing the direct costs of resources spent on health care, law enforcement, children and youth in
care, special education, supportive housing, and long-term care. The resultsfrom this analysis
demonstrated that the economic cost associated with FASD in Canada was approximately $1.8 billion
annually in direct costs alone.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is the federal lead for addressing FASD in Canada.
Awareness raising initiatives focus on four key pillars: raising public awareness; preventing alcohol use in
pregnancy; improving the health and social outcomes for individuals with FASD; and, facilitating access
to data.
Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) currently invests $17.9 million annually to support FASD prevention
activities in First Nations and Inuit communities through regionally based solutions. This includes a
funding increase as part of the Budget 2017 announcement of an additional $83.2 million over five years
to expand Indigenous maternal and child health services with $3.7 million ongoing for FASD starting in
2022-23.
Health Canada leads the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy (CDSS) that aims to protect the health
and safety of all Canadians by minimizing harms from substance use for individuals, families and
communities, including harms caused by alcohol consumption (e.g., FASD). Health Canada also provides
grants and contribution funding through the Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP) to respond
to drug and substance use issues, including efforts related to FASD.
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invests over $6.5 million in projects that are currently
investigating social epigenetics, the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), brain development and
mental health, proteins that may be developmentally protective, pediatric neuroimaging,
neurobiomarkers, and nutritional preventive intervention in the context of FASD.
The Kids Brain Health Network (KBHN) is receiving $50.8 million from 2009-2024 to improve the
outcomes for children and families impacted by neurodevelopmental disabilities, including FASD as a
national Network Centre of Excellence under the Networks of Centres of Excellence Program (NCE). The
NCE is a Canadian government initiative, which funds partnerships between universities, industry,
government and not-for-profit organizations to create large-scale research networks. As a research
network, KBHN engages with community groups, non-profit organizations, industry, parents, clinicians,
health professionals, provincial and federal governments to advance knowledge to improve outcomes
for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including FASD, and their families.
IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON CHIDLREN: AUTISM
• The Government of Canada recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected autistic
children across all aspects of their lives and is committed to improving the health and well-being of
autistic children and their families.
• The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted people on the autism spectrum and their families by
limiting access to in-person supports, disrupting education and personal routines, and making it
challenging to maintain social relationships with family and friends.
• Addressing the complex and diverse needs of autistic children requires a coordinated effort with
all levels of government and service providers.
• We are working closely with the autism community to contribute to the shared goals of helping
and supporting the needs of autistic children, as well as those who care for them, andto provide much
needed support.
• In order to address the critical data gap on the wider health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on autistic Canadian children and youth, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is investing over $2
million over three years to support the collection of a second cycle of the Canadian Health Survey on
Children and Youth (CHSCY), with data collection to begin in 2023.
• Similar to the first cycle of CHSCY in 2019, this second cycle will allow for further reporting on
the prevalence of autism among children and youth in Canada and characteristics of this group (i.e.,
health status, school experiences, etc.), as well as provide information on diagnostic trajectories and
much needed data on the wider health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
• In April 2020, PHAC provided $75,000 to the Autism and Intellectual Disabilities Knowledge
Exchange Network (AIDE Canada) to develop a COVID-19 Resource Hub to share up-to-date, trusted
information related to COVID-19 that is specifically tailored to Canadians on the autism spectrum,their
families and caregivers.
• PHAC is also leveraging the Autism Spectrum Disorder Strategic Fund to develop projects to
addresspriority needs to provide tangible opportunities for Canadians on the autism spectrum–as well
as their families and caregivers–to gain knowledge, resources and skills.
• Budget 2021 provided $15.4 million ($7 million in new funding) over two years, starting in 2021-
22, to work collaboratively with provinces, territories, families and stakeholders toward the creationof a
national autism strategy.
• PHAC is leading the development of a national autism strategy and provided $1.67 million to the
CanadianAcademy of Health Sciences to undertake an inclusive, evidence-based assessment on autism.
This assessment provided Canadians–including those within the autism community–with the
opportunity to inform the development of the strategy.
• PHAC continues to engage with provinces, territories, and Indigenous Peoples through a variety
of mechanisms on the national autism strategy, and is organizing a national conference in November
2022 to build consensus on the priorities for action.
• These initiatives willposition the Government of Canada to address current and longstanding
challenges that autistic individuals face, and advance the overall response and recovery for the COVID-
19 pandemic.
BACKGROUND
The Minister of Health’s 2021 Mandate Letter directsthe Minister to work in collaboration with
provinces, territories, families and stakeholders to accelerate the development of the national autism
strategy. This reiterates the 2019 Mandate Letter commitment to work towards the creation of a
national autismstrategy.
Budget 2021: Budget 2021 announced $15.4 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to PHAC to
work with partners to support the creation of a National Autism Strategy with $8.4 million coming from
existing PHAC funds; resulting in $7 millionin new funding. The existing funds reflect the residual
balance of Budget 2018 funding ($20 million over 5 years from 2018 to 2023) to support community-
based projects to address the challenges of autism spectrum disorder over the lifespan.
PHAC Investments: The Government of Canada is funding programs and projects to directly reach
autistic Canadians and those in the autism community who need information, resources and tools.
Budget 2018 provided $20 million over five years to support two new initiatives:
1) The Autism and Intellectual Disabilities Knowledge Exchange Network (AIDE Canada) ($10.9
million/5 years) provides centralized access to the latest evidence-based research, information,
resources and supports on autism in both official languages. In addition, six AIDE Canada locations
across the country provide a point of access for Canadians to obtain resources and supports on autism.
AIDE Canada also released a COVID-19 Resource Hub to share up-to-date, trusted information related to
COVID-19 specifically tailored to autistic Canadians, their families and caregivers.
2) The Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Strategic Fund is providing $9.1 million over 5 years for
community-based projects that pursue innovative program models, help reduce stigma, and integrate
health, social and educational components to better serve the complex needs of autistic Canadians and
their families.
PHAC Surveillance Activities: On February 3, 2022, PHAC released a report titled “Autism Spectrum
Disorder–Highlights from the2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth.” This report is one
of the key commitments made as part of Budget 2021 to support the development of a national autism
strategy. It provides new evidence on prevalence, health status and life experiencesof Canadian
children and youth with diagnosed ASD, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Budget 2022: PHAC is investing over $2 million over three years to support the collection of a second
cycle of the Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY).This second cycle of CHSCY will
allow for further reporting on the prevalence and characteristics of autistic Canadian children and youth,
the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and information regarding pathways to diagnosis.
Pandemic Canadian Autism Needs Assessment Survey: Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, Autism
Speaks Canada, the McMaster Autism Research Team, and the Canadian Autism Spectrum Disorder
Alliance developed the “Pandemic Canadian Autism Needs Assessment Survey” to capture the unique
impact of the pandemic on the autism community. This anonymous survey collected data from 1,066
caregivers of autistic children, youth and self-advocates/autistic adults from across Canada in May 2020.
Key findings highlighted that:
o Over 75% of respondents reported feeling stressed, worried, and anxious.
o The greatest impacts on children reported by caregivers were disruptions in education and
learning, and challenging behaviours and relationships with family and friends.
o Access to supports and services–including recreation programs, health professionals and an
autism-specific hotline–were either extremely challenging to access or not accessible, and many
respondents felt these services would have been useful.
Senate Bill S-203: On November 24,2021, the Honourable Leo Housakos introduced Bill S-203, An Act
Respecting a Federal Framework on Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Senate. The purpose of the Act is
to bring forth the development of a federal framework to support autistic Canadians, theirfamilies and
their caregivers. The Act outlines requirements for the development of a federal framework, including
measures to be provided such as financial support for autistic persons, support for caregivers, online
resources and best practices, a national research network and a national awareness campaign. The Act
also sets out requirements for consultation, a national conference, and regular reporting to Parliament
on implementation of the framework.
Bill S-203 was referred to Committee on December 8,2021. On April 27, 2022, the Standing Committee
on Social Affairs, Science and Technology passed the Bill (as amended during clause by clause
consideration on April 6, 2022). On May 12, 2022, the Bill, as amended, was passed in the Senate and
then referred to the House of Commons.
Language Note: A “person-first” approach, which acknowledges the person before the disability, is seen
in wording such as “individuals with autism”. In “identity-first” language, you would see phrases such as
“autistic Canadian”. The language used to describe an individual is personal. The Government of Canada
acknowledges the diverse views of Autistic Canadians, their caregivers and the community as a whole.
Using an individual’s expressed preferred language is encouraged whenever possible.
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH
• The Government of Canada is committed to supporting the mental health/substance use needs
of children and youth. This commitment is reflected in ongoing, pandemic-related and future initiatives.
• This builds on work by the government to increase access to mental health and addictions
services for children and youth, including through 2017 commitment of $5 billion in funding to provinces
and territories over 10 years through bilateral agreements, with one of the funding priorities expanded
access to community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth (age 10-25).
• In addition, in response to the pandemic, in April 2020 Health Canada launched Wellness
Together Canada, an online mental health and substance use support portal, which received $140
million in Budget 2022 for two more years of funding starting in 2022-23. This Portal provides access for
children and youth (ages 5 to 29) to mental health and substance use resources, including Kids Help
Phone.
• Recognizing the ongoing importance of supporting the mental health of Canadians the
government appointed the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. Her mandate includes
working cross-departmentally to ensure children and youth have access to mental health supports as
they recover from the pandemic as well as in the long-term.
IF PRESSED ON FUNDING FORCHILDREN AND YOUTH
• In addition to Wellness Together Canada, which provides online, phone and text based support
to young people who are in crisis or dealing with mental health issues, additional resources are being
invested in Kids Help Phone ($14.8M over 36 months from April 2020 to March 2023) so it can continue
to provide mental health support to youth in need during the pandemic.
• Budget 2021 announced $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those
most affected by the pandemic, including youth.
• Other investments include:
o $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protectivefactors to promote mental
health for children, youth and other populations experiencing mental health inequities.
o The Government is also investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustaina pan-Canadian suicide prevention service with their
partners. The Canada Suicide Prevention Service currently provides 24/7 suicide crisis support over the
phone to everyone Canada.
IF PRESSED ONMANDATE COMMITMENTS
• Minister Bennett remains committedto ensuring that mental health is treated as full and equal
part of the universal healthcare system. To this end, she will continue to engage with partners and
stakeholders and Canadians of all backgrounds, including individuals with lived and living experience.
BACKGROUND
Mental illness health issues can impact any population and children and youth are no exception. In fact,
two thirds or more of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25. It is estimated that mental
health issues affect over 800,000 Canadian children and youth annually.
Youth disproportionately visit the Emergency Department (ED) seeking mental health/substance use
services. For example, between 2008-2009 and 2018-19 there was a 61% increase in visits made by
youth to the ED for such services. During this time, hospitalizations for mental health disorders also
increased by 60%.
This cohort is also affected by suicide. In 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death among
individuals aged 15 to 34, behind unintentional injuries. In 2019, among individuals aged 10 to 14 years,
males accounted for 46% of suicide deaths; and among individuals aged 15 to 19 years, males account
for 64% of suicide deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the mental healthof children and youth.
Concerns about the virus itself have been compounded by impacts on school and routines, social
activities, isolation, and decreased access to services and supports.
Results from 2020 showed that youth were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health as
compared to older Canadians. While most Canadians were less likely to report excellent or very good
mental health during the COVID-19 period, the difference between 2018 and 2020 was particularly
evident for younger adults. Only 42% of those aged 15 to 24 reported excellent or very good mental
health during the pandemic compared to 62% before the pandemic in 2018.
More recent survey results from early 2021 showed that younger Canadians persistently indicate the
highest anxiety and depression of all age groups. For example, almost 30% of 16 to 17 year olds
reported high levels of anxiety and depression, and one in three reported suicidal ideation in the past
year. Conversely, this group reported a lower incidence of diagnosis of a mental health issue, suggesting
they do not have access to diagnostic services and care.
These findings are consistent with the percentage of youth reporting that their mental health was
“somewhat worse” or “much worse” now compared to beforethe pandemic-35% in March/April 2021.
Additionally, in a Statistics Canada survey of perceptions of personal safety, 11% of Youth aged 15 to 24
reported that harassment or attacks on the basis of race, ethnicity, or skin colour have increased in their
neighbourhood since the start of the pandemic.
Government Actions and Investments to Support the Mental Health Needs of Children and Youth
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments and Integrated Youth Services
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improveCanadians’ access to mental
health services (2017-2027). The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via
negotiated bilateral agreements, informed by the 2017 Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities agreed toby FPT Ministers of Health. In it, Ministers of Health agreed to prioritize
expanded access to community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth as
one of three priorities for the federal funding.
Eleven out of thirteen provinces/territories have identified youth focused initiatives, which could include
integrated youth services, as part of their bilateral agreement action plans. Three provinces have
specifically identified integrated youth services as part of their action plans.
Integrated Youth Services (IYS) models of care provide locally relevant, effective, youth-focused and
integrated services for mental health/substance use within the community. One example of this model
is the integrated youth hub. These hubs are easily accessible community-based “one stop shops” that
provide an integrated suite of services, which can include peer support, mental health and primary care
support and employment counselling, as well as support for navigating these systems of care. Each hub
leverages existing services so the suite of available services varies by hub. There are currently 50
operational integrated youth hubs across Canada and 60 under development.
In addition, nine out of ten provinces have or are developing a provincial networks to implement and
advance the integrated youth services model through the sharing of best practices. In some cases, this is
done through the leveraging of a learning health system approach, where data is collected to
continuously inform and improve equitable health outcomes by focusing on practices relating to
equitable access to mental health services. Three of the most established networks are in British
Columbia (Foundry), Ontario (Youth Wellness Hubs Ontario), and Quebec (Aire Ouverte) with BC and
Ontario specifically identifying the use of bilateral funding to support these networks.
Integrated youth services is also a priority area of National Mental Health and Substance Use Service
Standards, which will be developed to improve access to services,and address domains of quality,
including safety, effectiveness, patient-centredness, cultural appropriateness, and equity. Standards will
equip healthcare providers, policy makers and other stakeholders with an evidence-based framework
for delivering high-quality mental health and substance use services. Standards will also serve to
formalize what Canadians can reasonably expect in terms of the services available to them, including
timeliness, consistency and quality.
On March 14th, the Government of Canada announced that it is working with the Standards Council of
Canada-a Federal Crown Corporation with demonstrated expertise in developing national standards-
to develop a suite of a national standards for mental health and substance use services, leveraging
significant work done to date in this field.
Mental Health Promotion and Teen Dating Violence
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
PHAC also funds programming to prevent teen and youth dating violence, including community and
school-based initiatives that teach skills for healthy and safe relationships based on respect and consent.
In addition, PHAC funds initiatives to support the health of survivors of family violence, including
trauma-informed physical and mental health promotion for youth.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is also investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service with its partners. The Canada Suicide Prevention Service currently provides suicidecrisis support
over the phone to everyone in Canada. By 2023, this service will provide people across Canada with
access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from trained responders, using the technology of their choice
(voice, text or chat). The FederalFramework for Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It
focused on raising public awareness, reducing stigma, disseminating information and data, and
promoting the use of research and evidence-based practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are
available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned for release in December 2022. In response to
motion M-174, which called on the Government of Canada to establish a national suicide prevention
action plan and was unanimously supported by parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of
Canada is developing an action plan that aligns with the Framework.
Funding to the Mental Health Commission of Canada
The Government of Canada provides $14.25 annually to the Mental Health Commission of Canada
(MHCC), which was created in 2007 to act as a catalyst for improving the mental health system in
Canada. The MHCC leads the development and dissemination of programs and tools to support the
mental health and wellness of all Canadians by bringing together federal, provincial, and territorial
governments as well as leading mental health organizations.
In 2020, the MHCC developed the National Standard of Canada for Mental Health and Well-Being for
Post-Secondary Students, a set of flexible guidelines to help post-secondary institutions create
environments that foster student mental health and well-being.The Standard can help post-secondary
institutions better design their mental health policies and programs based on evidence, to share
experience and knowledge, while simultaneously improving mental health literacy, building resilience
and addressing student mental health issues before they worsen.
To date, around 47 post-secondary institutions are in the process of implementing the standard with
another 22 preparing for implementation.
Pandemic-Response Initiatives
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada invested $130 million from 2020-2022 in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal, and received $140 million in Budget 2022 to support the portal
for two more years, beginning in 2022-23. Launched in April 2020,Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessionswith social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access.
There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide immediate accessto
support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that can assist with
finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial and territorial
services, and does not replace them. In January 2022, Wellness Together Canada launched PocketWell,
which is a companion app to the online Portal.
Through the Portal and the app, children and youth (ages 5 to 29) are able to access mental health and
substance use resources, including Kids Help Phone, which provides online, phone and text based
support to young people who are in crisis or dealing with mental health issues.
Additional resources are being invested in Kids Help Phone ($14.8M over 36 months from April 2020 to
March 2023) provide mental health support to youth in need during the pandemic.
As of May 23, over 2.4 million individuals across all provinces and territories have accessed the Wellness
Together Canada portal in over 6.9 million web sessions. The new PocketWell mobile app has been
downloaded a total of 25,731 times. Additionally, over 45% of registered clients of the portal are under
30, an age group that tends to underutilize traditional mental health services.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 announced $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those most
affected by the pandemic, including youth. Funded projects are expected to begin in Spring 2022 and to
reach diverse populations across Canada. Projects will support mental health promotion and mental
illness prevention interventions, in addition to initiatives that build the capacity of service providers to
deliver programming in safe, effective and trauma-informed ways.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence to Underpin Initiatives
Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $333
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects
led by experts across the country.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative currently supports 101 research projects, representing a total
investment of $13.5 million from CIHR and partners. This workis guided by an Expert Advisory Panel
composed of leading Canadian experts in mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated
through these projects will be mobilized to ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
CIHR provided the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse with a $1 million directed grant to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providers in light
of COVID-19. This includes the creation of six national guidance documents and a rapid assessment of
the challenges faced by people who use drugs during the COVID-19 crisis to guide future policy
decisions.
Statistics Canada developed and administers a web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. In addition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cycles of
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health to better understand the wider impacts of the
pandemic on mental health in Canada. A special collection of research articles based on the first cycle of
data was released in the Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention Journal on September 27,
2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also resumed in September 2020. The Canadian
Community Health Survey provides data on a variety of mental health indicators, and has been collected
for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for ongoing measurement of changes inmental
health of the Canadian population as the pandemic continues and as Canada recovers.
SMOKING AND TOBACCO USE IN CANADA
• Our Government is committed to helping Canadians quit using tobacco and to protecting the
health ofyoung people and non-smokers.
• Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death, and we are
working to decrease tobacco use inCanada to less than 5% by 2035.
• Health Canada is updating tobacco labelling requirements toreflect the latest scientific
evidence. We will continue to strengthen regulations to prevent youth and non-smokers from becoming
addicted and to provide Canadians with information on the health hazards of tobacco use.
IF PRESSED ON HELP FOR PERSONS WHOSMOKE
• We urge Canadians who smoke to consider quitting. When you give up cigarettes, your body
starts to renew itself as early as the first day, reducing your chance of developing heart disease, cancer,
breathing problems, and infections.
• Quitting smoking can be difficult, but it is possible. The Government of Canada has many
resources to help.
• Canadians can contact the pan-Canadian toll-free quitline where trained specialists can help
them develop a plan, answer questions, and provide referrals to programs and services in their
community where available.
IF PRESSED ON THE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW
• The Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) requires a legislative review of the Act on a two
year cycle, three years after thelegislation comes into force.
• The first review is underway and is assessing whether the Act is achieving its objectives,
particularly those related to protecting young people.
• In March and April 2022, Health Canada sought input from Canadians to inform this review and
is reviewingthe feedback received.
• The final report will be tabled in Parliament in 2022 and will be made public onCanada.ca.
IF PRESSED ONTOBACCO COST RECOVERY
• The tobacco industry is responsible for the leading preventable cause of diseaseand premature
death in Canada.
• That is why my mandate letter includes a commitment to require tobacco manufacturers to pay
for federal public healthinvestments in tobacco control.
• Health Canada is working with partners within the federal government to examine options and
determine next steps.
• I look forward to engaging external stakeholders to realize this commitment.
IF PRESSED ON TOBACCOLABELLING REGUATIONS
• The Government of Canada is committed to reducing the devastating harms of tobacco use.
• That is why we are proposing to update health warning messages and to extend them to all
tobacco product packages to maintain their effectiveness.
• We are also proposing that Canada become the first country to introduce written health
warnings on certain individual tobacco products, like cigarettes, so it would be virtually impossible to
avoid health warnings altogether.
• We have launched a 75-day consultation to seek input from Canadians on these proposed
measures. I look forward to hearing the public’s views.
BACKGROUND
Tobacco use in Canada
Data released on September 8th 2021, from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), show
the largest annual smoking decline in the survey’s history, decreasing from 4.7M to 4.2M Canadians 12
years of age and older. Decades of tobacco control have seen positive impacts, resulting in a national
average rate of 13% (4.2M) down from 15% (4.7M) in 2019. Daily smoking also declined to 9% (2.9M)
from 10% (3.2M) in 2019. A reliable estimate on daily smoking for youth aged 15-19 cannot be
determined for 2020.
While the recent declines are positive, millions of Canadians are still smoking, reminding us that, despite
decades of effort to deter smoking, tobacco use remains a significant public health problem in Canada.
Tobacco use is still the leading cause ofpremature death in Canada, killing half of all Canadians who
smoke daily for a long time. Furthermore, prevalence rates for on-reserve First Nations and Inuit are
higher than that of other Canadians.
In July 2020, the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction released an update of its report
entitled “Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms 2015–2017”. The report identifies the enormous
burden tobacco use places on all Canadians. The report found that in 2017 the total cost of tobacco use
to society was approximately $12.3 billion or $336 for every Canadian. Tobacco use was identified as the
deadliest and most costly substance by far accounting for 47% of all attributable health care costs from
substance use and approximately 48,000 premature deathsin 2017 (over 128 deaths per day or 17% of
all deaths).
Canada’s Tobacco Strategy
Canada’s Tobacco Strategy represents the Government of Canada’s plan to address tobacco use. It is led
by Health Canada, in partnership with the Canada Border Services Agency, the Canada Revenue Agency,
Indigenous Services Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, the Public Health
Agency of Canada, Public Safety Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Tobacco Cost Recovery/Levy
Minister Bennett’s mandate letter includes a commitment to require tobacco manufacturers to pay for
the cost of federal public health investments in tobacco control. Health Canada is working closely with
other Government of Canada partners, including departments who receive funding under Canada’s
Tobacco Strategy, to examine options and determine next steps. The department will also consult with
external stakeholders as part of its analysis.
Both the Conservative Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party made similar commitments in
their election platforms.
Proposed Labelling Regulations
On June 11 2022, Health Canada published the proposed Regulations Amending the Tobacco Products
Regulations (Plain and Standardized Appearance) and proposed Order Amending Schedule 1 to the
Tobacco and Vaping Products Act in the Canada Gazette Part I (CGI) for a 75-day consultation period.
The public consultation closes August 25th, 2022.
The proposed regulations would build on existing requirements by updating current health-related
messages, extending messaging requirements to all tobacco product packages and implementing
periodic rotation of messages among other measures. A key feature of the proposed regulations is the
introduction of written health warnings printed on individual cigarettes, cigars that have a filter, and
cigarette tubes. This new packaging would help to ensure that health-related messages reach people
who often access cigarettes one at a time in social situations, particularly youth and young adults.
YOUTH VAPING
• Our Government is pleased to see that vaping rates among Canadian youth have stabilized,
according to a recent survey.
• Nonetheless, our Government remains concerned about substance use, including youth vaping,
and is taking comprehensive action.
• Regulations now prohibit the promotion and advertising of vaping products anywhere they can
be seen or heard by youth.
• New regulations are also now in force setting a maximum nicotine concentration for all vaping
products, and Health Canada has consulted Canadians on proposed regulations to restrict flavours in
vaping products to make them less attractive.
IF PRESSED ON THE YOUTH-ORIENTED PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN
• In 2019, Health Canada launched the Consider the Consequences of Vaping prevention
campaign, investing more than $14 million to date.
• The campaign has included in-print and online advertising, as well as an interactive learning tour
in schools and community venues or virtually. Vaping awareness kits were provided to allmiddle and
high schools, and information resources sent to health care professionals.
• The interactive learning tour has reached over 156,000 youth in over 937 schools across the
country, and will continue to reach more
IF PRESSED ON COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENTOF CURRENT MEASURES
• The Tobacco and Vaping Products Act has significant restrictions in place to limit youth access to
vaping products and promotions.
• Health Canada has taken actions that have led companies to remove lifestyle advertising from
television and in-store displays, and online content from social media influencers.
• In 2019, Health Canada inspected more than 3,000 retailers and seized more than 80,000 units
of non-compliant vaping products. Between July 2020 and March 2021, over 300online inspections of
Canadian vaping retailers’ Instagram accounts were conducted and approximately 160 warning letters
issued.
IF PRESSED ON THE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW
• Section 60.1(1) of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) requires a legislativereview of
the Act on a two year cycle, three years after the legislation comes into force.
• The first review will assess the operation of the Act and whether it is achieving its vaping-related
objectives, particularly those related to protecting young people.
• In March and April 2022, Health Canada sought input from Canadians to inform this review and
is reviewing the feedback received.
• The final report will be tabled in Parliament in 2022 and will be made public onCanada.ca.
IF PRESSED ONFLAVOURS REGULATIONS
• On June 19th, 2021, Health Canada published the proposed order to amend the Tobacco and
Vaping Products Act (flavours) and the proposed Standards for Vaping Products’ Sensory Attributes
Regulations.
• The proposed regulations would implement a complementary three-pronged approach to
restricting the flavours of vaping products.
• The consultations closed on September 2, 2021. Health Canada received over 25,000
submissions and is currently reviewing the input it received from Canadians.
BACKGROUND
Since late 2018, the Government of Canada has implemented a comprehensive suite of measures to
address youth vaping, including enhanced public education, increased compliance and enforcement of
existing rules and advancing regulations to put in place more controls.
Health Canada’s national public education campaign “Consider the Consequences of Vaping” informs
youth and their parents about the risks and harms associated with vaping through advertising,
interactive learning tours in schools and online. To date, Health Canada hasinvested more than $14
million.
Enforcing the strong set of controls already established under the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act
remains an important part of the Government’s efforts. The department has taken action to shut down
illegal promotions by major national brands.
The Vaping Products Promotion Regulations came into force on August 7, 2020. These regulations
prohibit any vaping product promotions in locations or media visible to youth. Additionally, the
regulationsrequire all remaining permitted ads to include clear health warnings to increase awareness
of the risks of these products.
In addition, the Vaping Product Labeling and Packaging Regulations came into force on July 1, 2020.
These regulations require that vaping products containing nicotine display a standardized nicotine
concentration statement and a health warning about the addictiveness of nicotine as well as a toxicity
warning to further increase awareness of the risks.
On July 8, 2021, new Nicotine Concentration in Vaping Products Regulations came into force, which set a
maximum nicotine concentration for vaping products sold to 20 mg/ml, down from 66 mg/ml. As of July
23, 2021, it is prohibited to sell any vaping products with a nicotine concentration higher than 20 mg/ml
in Canada.
Building on feedback from consultations in 2019, on June 19th, 2021, Health Canada published the
proposed Order Amending Schedules 2 and 3 to the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (flavours) and the
proposed Standards for Vaping Products’ Sensory Attributes Regulations. The proposal is a three-
pronged approach to restricting flavoured vaping products. The proposal would restrict the promotion
of flavours in vaping products to tobacco, mint, and menthol; prohibit all sugars and sweeteners and
most flavouring ingredients; and prescribe sensory attributes standards to prevent a sensory perception
other than one that is typical of tobacco or mint/menthol. The consultation period for the proposed
regulations closed September 2, 2021 and the department is reviewing feedback on this proposal.
On April 19, 2021, Finance Canada announced its intention to implement a tax on vaping products in
2022, through the introduction of a new excise duty framework. Budget 2022 proposed to implement
the excise duty, effective as of October 1, 2022. The proposed federal excise duty rate would be $1.00
per 2 mL, or fraction thereof, for containers with less than 10 mL of vaping liquid. For containers with
more than 10 mL, the applicable federal rate would be $5.00 for the first 10 mL, and $1.00 for every
additional 10 mL, or fraction thereof. The federal government also invited its provincial and territorial
counterparts to join a coordinated vaping taxation framework, under which an additional duty equalto
the proposed federal rate would be applied.
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death and disease in Canada. Smoking-related
disease is caused by the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in smoke. Vaping products expose users to far
fewer toxic chemicals and substances than conventional cigarettes, and are less harmful alternatives to
tobacco products if users quit smoking and switch completely to vaping.
However, vaping is not harmless. Vaping nicotine can lead to addiction and physical dependence and
youth are especially susceptible to the negative effects of nicotine. Moreover, the long-term health
effects of vaping are unknown. For these reasons, the TVPA seeks to protect the health of youth and
non-users from exposure to and dependence on nicotine, and help ensure that Canadians are not misled
with regard to the health hazards of using vaping products and/or nicotine.
Results from the 2021 Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey (CTNS) indicate that vaping rates among
Canadian youthhave stabilized; the rate of vaping was 13% among Canadians aged 15-19. Previously,
results from the CTNS survey in 2019 had shown a rapid increase in youth aged 15-19, with 14%
reporting past 30 day use compared to 6% in 2017. Health Canada has not seen acorresponding
increase in student smoking rates; these rates continue to be at all-time lows.
Section 60.1(1) of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) requires that the Minister perform a
legislative review of the Act on a two year cycle, three years after thelegislation comes into force.
The US Food and Drug Administration, under its Premarket Tobacco Product Application process, has
reviewed the applications of over 6 million vaping products to determine whether any meet the criteria
of protecting public health, taking into account the risks and benefits to the population as a whole.
While the review process has not been completed, on October 12, 2021 and on March 24, 2022, the
United States Food and Drug Administration announced it had authorized the marketing of certain
tobacco-flavoured vaping products. For these products, the FDA determined that the potential benefit
to smokers who switch completely or significantly reduce their cigarette use would outweigh the risk to
youth, provided the applicant follows post-marketing requirements aimed at reducing youth exposure
and access to the products (e.g., regular reporting to the FDA, marketing restrictions for digital, radio
and television advertising).
In Canada, the Food and Drugs Act applies tovaping products that make health claims, such as help to
quit smoking. These products must be authroized under this act before they can be advertised, sold, or
commercially imported. To date, no vaping products have been authorized under this Act and no
applications have been received.
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS INJURIES (PTSI)
• Every day, public safety personnel put their safety at risk to protect and help Canadians. As a
result, they are often exposed to dangerous and traumatic situations that may lead topost-traumatic
stress injuries (PTSI).
• The Government is proud to help those who never fail to help us by continuing to advance
Canada’s first-ever National Action Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries for public safety personnel,
launched on April 8, 2019.
• The Action Plan focuses on three key pillars: research and data collection; prevention, early
intervention and stigma reduction; and support for care and treatment.
• Under the Action Plan, the Government is investing $30 million over five years tosupport
research on PTSI. This includes the development of an Internet-delivered cognitive therapy pilot for
public safety personnel, which is operational in Saskatchewan, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island.
• In February 2022, we announced federal support of $1 million to Runnymede Healthcare Centre
for a feasibility study on a facility dedicated to rehabilitation and post-traumatic stress injuries for public
safety personnel.
• In the tragic circumstances where lives are lost, there is a memorial grant program providing
first responder families with $300,000 to help with the transitionin the loss of their loved one.
• The Government will continue to support our front-line workers.
BACKGROUND
Every day, public safety personnel are actively helping to build and reinforce community resilience,
putting their lives on the line by responding to crises, local emergencies and large-scale disasters. In
doing so, public safety personnel may experience traumatic events that trigger the onset of post-
traumatic stress injuries (PTSI) and operational stress injuries (any persistent psychological difficulty
resulting from operational duties). Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by
experiencing or witnessing traumatic events, such as fatal traffic accidents, combat situations and
natural disasters, which may lead to problems in functioning in social or family life and at work or at
school. The term “PTSI” has been adopted as a preferred terminology by the public safety community in
an effort to reduce the stigma commonly associated with a “disorder.”
On April 8, 2019, the Government of Canada announced the release of Supporting Canada’s Public
Safety Personnel:An Action Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries. The plan will support research,
prevention, early intervention, stigma-reduction, care and treatment for all types of public safety
personnel, all across the country.
The Action Plan was informed throughseveral consultations which began in 2016 with key stakeholders,
including Federal, Provincial and Territorial governments, the Public Safety and Health portfolios, public
safety organizations, academia, union representatives, mental health professionals and non-
governmental organizations.
Public safety personnel is a term that broadly encompasses front-line personnel who ensure the safety
and security of Canadians across all jurisdictions. Examples can include: tri-services (police–including
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, firefighters, and paramedics), correctional employees, border
services personnel, operational and intelligence personnel, search and rescue personnel, Indigenous
emergency managers, and dispatch (9-1-1) personnel.
The Action Plan builds on recent investments by theGovernment in this area, including:
• $20 million over five years to support a new National Research Consortium on PTSI among
public safety personnel between the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and the Canadian
Institute for Public Safety Research and Treatment (CIPSRT). This consortium is the first of its kind in
Canada and will work specifically to address the incidence of PTSI among public safety personnel.
• $10 million for an Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (ICBT) pilot to provide greater
access to care and treatment for public safety personnel, especially in rural and remote areas; and
• $400K for Road to Mental Readiness (R2MR) training. R2MR is an evidence-based program
designed to reduce mental health stigma, as well as to address and promote mental health resiliency
among public safety personnel.
Departmental officials are monitoring progress against the Action Plan. Notable results to date include:
• The National Research Consortium has been established, and CIHR hasawarded approximately
$12.2 million to date in applied research funding that will be undertaken in close partnership with public
safety personnel as the “end-user”.
• The official launch of the ICBT pilot in Saskatchewan took place on January 29th, 2020,with a
second pilot in Quebec launched in September 2020, and a third Maritime pilot was launched on
February 8, 2022.
The 2021 mandate letter of the Minister of Public Safety directed the Minister to work with the support
of the Minister of Mental Healthand Addictions to “continue advancing Canada’s first-ever National
Action Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries, including additional investment to support the health and
well-being of first responders.”
Budget 2021 provided $50 million over two years to Health Canada/Public Health Agency of Canada,
beginning in 2021-22, for a targeted call for proposals to support a trauma and posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) stream of mental health programming for populations at high risk of experiencing
COVID-19 related trauma. One of these identified high risk populations is public safety personnel.
• Stream One ($3 million): Knowledge Development and Exchange Hub that will synthesize and
mobilize knowledge to support funded projects as well as the broader community
• Stream Two ($47 million): Interventions that promote mental health and prevent mental illness;
build evidence about effective interventions; and enhance capacity of individuals, service providers and
organizations to address trauma and PTSD.
EXPLORE PATHWAYS TO INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN RURAL AREAS
• Our government recognizes that rural and remote communities in Canada face unique
challenges in providing access toquality mental health services.
• With COVID-19 creatingstress, anxiety, and isolation for many Canadians, our government is
investing in virtual mental health care. In April 2020, the Government of Canada launched an online
mental health and substance use support portal, Wellness Together Canada (WTC), whichprovides
Canadians with a broad rangeof free psycho-social supports.
• Tailored to meet the needs of varying age groups and diverse populations, the portal provides
access to free, credible information and supports, and is available 24/7 to all individuals living in Canada
regardless of their location, including those in isolation or remote areas. Confidential sessions with social
workers, psychologists and other professionals can be accessedby phone and text via the WTC.
• In addition, WTC recently launched PocketWell, a companion app to the Portal. Using
PocketWell individuals can link to the Portal to access the resources and can connect seamlessly to free
and confidential virtual sessions with mental health professional.
• Moving forward, the federalgovernment has committed to developing a permanent, ongoing
Canada Mental Health Transfer to help expand the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental
health services.
IF PRESSED ON MINISTERIAL MANDATE COMMITMENTS
• The government committed toensure that mental health care is treated as a full and equal part
of our universal health care system. As an integral part of this commitment, the government will be
exploring pathways to increase the accessibility of mentalhealth services in rural areas.
• In an effort to expand access to mental health services for Canadians, particularly for individuals
who experience marginalization and/or face barriers to accessing care, our government is committed to
establishing a permanent, ongoing Canada MentalHealth Transfer.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEED TO SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTHOF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
• The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on the mental wellness in Indigenous
peoples by magnifying existing mental health issues and inequities and creating new gaps and needs.
• Budget 2021 announced $597.6 million over three years for a distinctions-based mental
wellness approach for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis. This included the renewal of funding for the Hope
for Wellness Helpline, which providesimmediate, culturally-safe, telephone crisis intervention support
for First Nations and Inuit 24/7. It is available in English and French, and upon request, inCree, Ojibway,
and Inuktitut.
• The Government of Canada acknowledges that Indigenous Peoples are best placed to determine
and address their health care needs. This investment will ensure that First Nations, Inuit and Métis
Peoples are engaged in actions to foster health systems free from racism and discrimination, where
Indigenous Peoples are respected and safe and will support Indigenous partners to undertake
meaningful engagement on their health priorities.
• The federal government is committed to take action to foster health systems free from barriers,
including racism and discrimination.
BACKGROUND
2021 MANDATE COMMITMENTS
October 26, 2021, the Prime Minister appointed Dr. Carolyn Bennett as the First Minister of Mental
Health and Addictions. The Prime Minister released mandate letters on December 16, 2021, which
outline the objectives thateach minister will work to accomplish, as well as pressing challenges they will
address in their role. The new Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has been mandated to ensure
that mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of our universal health care system, working in
close collaboration with provinces and territories, and lead a whole-of-society approach to address
problematic substance use in Canada.
To realize these objectives, Minister Bennett will deliver in the following commitments:
• Work with the Minister of Health, and with the support of the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Finance, to establish a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help expand
the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
• Support the mental health of Canadians by developing and implement a comprehensive,
evidence-based plan, leveraging existing and new investments, including to:
o Develop mental health standards, with aparticular focus on health equity;
o Sustain improved access to virtual mental health services with Wellness Together Canada;
o Ensure timely access to perinatal mental health services;
o Implement a three-digit suicide prevention hotline; and
o Introducea new fund for student mental health that will support the hiring of new mental
health care counsellors, improve wait times for services, increase access overall and enable targeted
supports to Black and racialized students at post-secondary institutionsacross Canada.
• Support the Minister of Indigenous Services to co-develop and invest in a distinctions-based
Mental Health and Wellness Strategy to meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation,
including culturally appropriate wraparound services for addiction and trauma, suicide and life
promotion and the building of treatment centres.
• Oversee the implementation of our investments in mental health interventions and supports for
people disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including health care workers, front-line workers,
seniors, Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians.
• Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister for Women
and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as
they recover from the impact of the pandemic.
• Advance a comprehensive strategy to address problematic substance use in Canada, supporting
efforts to improve public education to reduce stigma, and supporting provinces and territories and
working with Indigenous communities to provide access to a full range of evidence-based treatment and
harm reduction, as well as to create standards for substance use treatment programs.
• Require tobacco manufacturers to pay for the cost of federal public health investments in
tobacco control.
• Support the Minister of Public Safety to continue advancing Canada’s first-ever National Action
Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries, including additional investment to support the healthand well-
being of first responders.
• Support the Minister of Veterans Affairs to ensure Canadian Armed Forces members and
Veterans have access to adequate mental health resources, services and training programs tailored to
their specific needs.
• With the support of the Minister of Rural Economic Development, explore pathways to increase
the accessibility of mental health services in rural areas.
Pressure on Existing Provincial/Territorial Mental Health Services
With Canadians physical distancingand isolated, there is an unprecedented need for virtual services,
such as telehealth and other information lines (e.g., 811), and provinces/territories are not able to
absorb the increased demand.
It is critical that Canadians have access to effectivetools to self-monitor, promote their mental well-
being, obtain credible and reliable information, and access services when deemed necessary. Canadians
need to be re-assured that there are supports available to help alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.
Canada Mental Health Transfer
The Government has provided funding to provinces and territories, community-based organizations and
used a range of federal levers to improve access to mental health services for Canadians. The
Government committed to implement a new Canada Mental Health Transfer (CMHT)–which would
provide a permanent, stable, and sustainable source(s) of funding to provinces and territories, dedicated
to mental health services. Currently, provinces and territories are receiving $5 billionover ten years to
support improvements in mental health services through bilateral agreements. Provinces and territories
can use the Canada Health Transfer to cover the costs of medically-necessary health services in their
jurisdiction, which can includemental health services. A new Canada Mental Health Transfer would help
to reduce the strain on other areas of the health care system and expand access to mental health
services for Canadians, particularly for individuals who experience marginalization and/or face barriers
to accessing care.
Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services and Address the
Impacts Of COVID-19 On Canadians’ Mental Health
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada has invested $130 million over twoyears in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist with finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national service offering support to young people via
phone, text and live chat, and is a global leader in developing anddelivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. ThroughBudget 2021, the government has allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadianscan access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health. Health Canada has
established a memorandum of agreement with the Standards Council of Canada to work with
stakeholders to develop six early national standards deliverables in priority areas. This process is
expected to be launched in early March 2022.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including health care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and
Métis, and Black and other racialized Canadians.
• $50 million over two years, starting in2021-22, to support projects to address posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access tocommunity-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of more than $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As partof this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association and Crisis Services Canada. By 2023,
this service will provide people across Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from
trained responders, using the technology of their choice (voice, text or chat). The Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focused on raising public awareness, reducing
stigma, disseminating information and data, andpromoting the use of research and evidence-based
practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned
for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the Government of Canada
to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously supported by
parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan that aligns
with the Framework.
