Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Category 4 Median lethal dose (LD50) (human): 558-1,746 mg/kg (estimated in cases resulting from consumption of contaminated pharmaceuticals) Footnote 1 Footnote 2. LD50 (rat): 12,570 mg/kg, with 17.5 mL/kg (19.6 g/kg) also having been reported Footnote 3 Footnote 4. The available human data meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral) – Category 4 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50 (rabbit): 12,432 mg/kg Footnote 5 (from 11.2 mL/kg, using specific gravity = 1.11 Footnote 6). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable Diethylene glycol is not a gas. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): Does not meet criteria No mortality was observed in rats exposed to substantially saturated vapours of diethylene glycol for 6 hours Footnote 5. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Vapours). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): Does not meet criteria No mortalities or adverse clinical signs were observed in a study (from a secondary source) where rats were exposed to the maximum attainable concentration of diethylene glycol for 4 hours (>4.6 mg/L of air) (based on study summary Footnote 4). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists). Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Does not meet criteria In a repeated occluded human patch test conducted according to a technique from Shelanski and Shelanski, 40 male volunteers were administered 25 mg of diethylene glycol (20% w/v mixture in talc) on the skin for 24 hours and then again 14 days later (based on study summary Footnote 4). Only mild skin irritation effects were observedFootnote 5. A rabbit patch test (occlusive) with diethylene glycol exposure for 23 hours resulted in a primary cutaneous irritation index of 0.04, which indicated the chemical was non-irritating in that study Footnote 7 Footnote 5. An in vitro skin irritation study using reconstructed human epidermis conducted according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 439 was performed on 3 tissue replicates (based on study summary Footnote 4), using undiluted diethylene glycol. Positive and negative controls were used. Mean tissue viability was 94.5% and according to OECD TG 439, tissue viability >50% is to be considered not irritating. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Corrosion / Irritation. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Does not meet criteria No ocular irritation was observed after the application of 0.5 mL of undiluted diethylene glycol in rabbits (Carpenter grade 1/10) Footnote 8. An acute ocular irritancy index of 11.67 in rabbits was observed in another study Footnote 7. Results were obtained using a modified Kay Calandra evaluation scale of 0 to 110, indicating that the test substance was "minimally irritating". No corneal injury or iritis was observed. In another study, minor to moderate conjunctival irritation occurred following application of 0.1 mL of diethylene glycol Footnote 5; however, no scores were reported and effects were fully reversible within 24 hours. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation. Respiratory Sensitization: No data available Skin Sensitization: Does not meet criteria In a repeated occluded human patch test conducted according to the technique from Shelanski and Shelanski, 40 male volunteers were administered 25 mg of diethylene glycol (20% w/v mixture in talc) on the skin for 24 hours and then challenged 14 days later (based on study summary Footnote 4). Observations made at 24 and 48 hours after removal of the patches indicated that diethylene glycol did not elicit visible skin changes due to skin sensitization at either time point. Diethylene glycol tested negative in a guinea pig maximization test performed according to EU Method B.6 (based on study summary Footnote 4). Female Pirbright White Dunkin guinea pigs (n=10) were induced with 2 intradermal injections each of 0.1 mL of Freund's adjuvant in 0.9% NaCl, of diethylene glycol and of diethylene glycol with Freund's adjuvant. Animals in the control group (n=5) were given the same injections, without diethylene glycol. Percutaneous induction occurred one week after intradermal induction. Diethylene glycol (0.3 g) was applied with an occlusive dressing for 48 hours. Challenge with 50% diethylene glycol and an occlusive dressing occurred for 24 hours, 21 days after intradermal induction. No skin reactions were observed in the control or test group 24 hours after challenge patch removal. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In vivo: Negative results were obtained in a mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test conducted in mice (intraperitoneal administration) conducted according to OECD TG 474 (based on study summary Footnote 4). Male mice (5 per dose) were intra-peritoneally administered diethylene glycol at 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg body weight per day. In vitro: Negative results were obtained in Ames tests conducted according to OECD TG 471 using Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535, TA 1537, TA 98 and TA 100 and Escherichia coli WP2 uvr A, with and without metabolic activation Footnote 5 Footnote 4. Chromosomal aberration tests and sister chromatid exchange tests were negative for diethylene glycol exposure in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without metabolic activation, conducted according to OECD TG 473 and 479, respectively Footnote 4 Footnote 5. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria Diethylene glycol has not been reviewed for carcinogenicity by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). In a carcinogenicity study, Fischer 344 rats were administered 0, 1.25, or 2.5% diethylene glycol in drinking water for 2 years after pre-treatment with N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine for tumor initiation (based on study summary Footnote 4). The incidences of tumors in all organs were not significantly increased. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Carcinogenicity. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria No evidence of reproductive toxicity was observed in a well-conducted study in which mice were administered diethylene glycol orally through gavage at a single dose of 11,180 mg/kg Footnote 9. In another study, positive results, including significant decreases in the fertility index, litters per pair, live pups per litter and live pup weight, were observed in mice only at the highest dose tested (3.5% in drinking water; equivalent to 6.1 g/kg/day); however, the reproductive effects were attributed to maternal toxicity by the study authors, which included decreased body and pituitary weights Footnote 10. In a developmental study conducted equivalently to OECD TG 414, no maternal or developmental toxicity was observed when 1,250 mg/kg/day diethylene glycol was administered by gavage to timed-pregnant mice on gestational days 6-15. The mid dose (5,000 mg/kg/day) produced significant maternal toxicity, but there was no clear evidence of developmental toxicity. The high dose (10,000 mg/kg/day) caused the death of 1 of 28 pregnant dams and resulted in maternal and developmental toxicity Footnote 11. In another study, rats and mice were administered diethylene glycol by gavage over the period of organogenesis at a dose of 1,110, 2,220, 4,440, or 8,880 mg/kg/day in rats (based on 1, 2, 4, or 8 mL/kg/day of undiluted diethylene glycol, respectively, and using a specific gravity of 1.11 Footnote 6) and 555, 2,775, or 11,100 mg/kg/day in mice (based on 0.5, 2.5 or 10.0 mL/kg/day of undiluted diethylene glycol, respectively, and using a specific gravity of 1.11 Footnote 6) Footnote 12 Footnote 13. Control animals received deionized water. No effects on reproduction were noted in either species at the low dose. In rats, maternal toxicity, including mortality, decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain, was noted at 4,440 and 8,880 mg/kg/day. Fetotoxicity was observed at 8,880 mg/kg/day as statistically significant decreases in fetal body weight and as skeletal variants. At 4,440 mg/kg/day, there was a statistically significantly increase in skeletal variants. In mice, maternal toxicity, including mortality, was noted at 11,100 mg/kg/day. Increased water consumption was noted at 2,775 mg/kg/day. No statistically significant fetotoxicity was observed at the mid or high dose. The fetotoxicity at the mid and high doses is considered secondary to maternal toxicity. No signs of maternal toxicity or fetal toxicity were noted in an oral gavage study conducted similarly to OECD TG 414 in rabbits gavaged with doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day on gestation days 7-19 Footnote 14 Footnote 4. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Category 1 Oral Route of Exposure: Central nervous system (CNS) effects, such as headache, difficulty speaking, numbness, paralysis, loss of tactile sensation, peripheral neuropathy, loss of consciousness, convulsion, difficulty swallowing, cranial nerve palsies, acute flaccid extremity weakness and encephalopathy, and kidney failure were reported in several cases of human diethylene glycol poisoning Footnote 1 Footnote 15 Footnote 16 Footnote 17 Footnote 18 Footnote 19 Footnote 20 Footnote 21 Footnote 22. Narcotic and diuretic effects and metabolic acidosis leading to death were observed in rats at 17.5 mL/kg of exposure to diethylene glycol (19.6 g/kg) Footnote 3. The available human data meet the classification criteria for Category 1 based on CNS effects. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available Inhalation Route of Exposure: Rats exposed to the highest attainable concentration of aerosolized diethylene glycol (4.6 mg/L) for 4 hours exhibited decreased activity with rapid recovery on removal and nasal discharge or lacrimation in a single exposure study (based on study summaryFootnote 4). These results do not meet classification criteria. The available data meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure – Category 1 [HPR 8.8.1]. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: In an OECD TG 407 study, no mortality, clinical signs, or changes in body weight were observed in rats administered up to 10,000 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol in feed for 28 days (based on study summary Footnote 4). No statistically significant changes in renal function were observed in rats administered 0.2 g/kg of diethylene glycol in drinking water for 90 days Footnote 23. No deleterious effects on growing rats were observed following ingestion of 0.3% or 1.0% diethylene glycol in drinking water for 175 days Footnote 24. In a 14-week (98-day) study, no kidney-related effects were observed at 300 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol exposure (based on study summary Footnote 4). Hydropic degeneration of the kidneys started to occur at 1,550 mg/kg/day. A study in rats (5 per sex per dose) fed 11, 46, 180, or 850 mg/kg/day for 32 days reported no significant adverse signs of toxicity Footnote 25. Another study in rats (10 per sex per dose) fed 51, 105, 234, or 1194 mg/kg/day (males) or 64, 126, 292, or 1462 mg/kg/day (females) of diethylene glycol for 225 days (32 weeks) reported no significant adverse signs of toxicity Footnote 25. Another study in rats (15-20 per sex per dose) fed 0, 1200 or 2300 mg/kg/day of diethylene glycol for 90 days to 2 years reported no significant signs of toxicity other than the development of a few bladder stones in male rats fed 2300 mg/kg/day Footnote 25. A study in rats exposed to 200 mg/kg/day of diethylene glcyol in drinking water reported no significant adverse signs of toxicity Footnote 25. The available data do not meet classification criteria. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available Inhalation Route of Exposure: A study was conducted in rats (5 per sex per dose) exposed to 0, 0.53, 3 or 5.06 mg/L diethylene glycol particulate for 6 hours per day for 9 days (5 days exposure, 2 days off, 4 days exposure). No significant adverse signs of toxicity were reported other than minor changes in hematological and clinical chemistry parameters Footnote 25.
