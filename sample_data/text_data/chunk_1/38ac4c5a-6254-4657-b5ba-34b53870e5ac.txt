Notes: The purpose of this compliance verification project was to verify industry's compliance of cosmetic products with specific requirements of the FDA and the Cosmetic Regulations. Products containing certain substances on the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist (Hotlist) indicated as being prohibited or restricted for use in cosmetics were tested, specifically oxidative hair dyes intended for consumer use that contain the restricted ingredient p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) and/or its salts at a maximum concentration equal to or less than 3% after dilution with an oxidizer, as per the manufacturer's instructions.

The purpose of this compliance verification project was to verify industry's compliance of cosmetic products with specific requirements of the FDA and the Cosmetic Regulations. Products containing certain substances on the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist (Hotlist) indicated as being prohibited or restricted for use in cosmetics were tested, specifically oxidative hair dyes intended for consumer use that contain the restricted ingredient p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) and/or its salts at a maximum concentration equal to or less than 3% after dilution with an oxidizer, as per the manufacturer's instructions. For this project, compliance of cosmetic products with the FDA and the Cosmetic Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada selected relevant products from both physical and online establishments. Compliance with the restriction for the ingredient PPD, as indicated on the Hotlist, was verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Over the course of the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, chemistry testing of 49 different products was carried out. All products tested were compliant as the selected oxidative hair dyes samples were below the 3% maximum concentration of PPD and/or its salts. The label review of the products resulted in 1 recall (involving 2 products), 2 stop distributions and 22 commitments to address non-compliance. There were 23 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

No compliance issues identified None Disclaimer: Inspectors apply a systematic bias during the selection of establishments and samples. Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
