The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of consumer chemical products with the requirements of the Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001 (CCCR, 2001). For this project, compliance of select consumer chemicals with the CCCR, 2001 was determined through a review of classification documents requested from establishments by Health Canada inspectors. Some of these products were sampled and sent to the CPSP's Product Safety Laboratory to have relevant regulatory criteria verified through laboratory testing. Prior to initiating inspections, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of consumer chemicals and establishments in Canada. Some targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2020 to 2021 fiscal year, 37 different animal grooming products were evaluated against the packaging, labelling and other performance criteria within the CCCR, 2001 (including flammability, corrosivity, viscosity and pH testing). The compliance verification inspections resulted in 10 recalls, 5 stop distributions and 4 commitments to address non-compliance. There were 18 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
