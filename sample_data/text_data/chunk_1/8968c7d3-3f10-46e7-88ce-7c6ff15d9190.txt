• FEWO has spent some time considering violence against women during their previous studies.
The Committee’s first study took place from February 4 to June 15, 2022 and focused on Intimate
Partner and Domestic Violence in Canada, with the report tabled in the House of Commons on June 17,
2022. The second study, on Resource Development and Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls,
was started on April 26, 2022, and concluded on September 22, 2022; the report is currently being
drafted. This study, which began on Monday, September 26, 2022, focuses on young women and girls,
and the mental health issues particular to their experiences, including the presence of online harms.
• On October 31, 2022, the Committee moved to undertake a study on women and girls in sport,
including their physical and emotional health and safety, and invite the Minister of Sport and other
witnesses to appear to testify; the studyon women and girls in sport will commence after this current
studyon mental health is completed.
• Current members of FEWO have raised the following issues in Committee, in the House of
Commons, and in social media (note that this list of topics refersto mental health leads only):
o Mental Health: CPC members are expected to continue focusing on the negative impacts of the
pandemic on children and youth, specifically with respect to mental health and the effects of the COVID-
19 pandemic. They have noted that mental health services are under-funded and have called for the
establishment of a three-digit suicide prevention hotline. During the FEWO’s current Study on the
Mental Health of Women and Girls, CPC members have expressed the need for youth-involved
solutions, and for tangible prevention and intervention measures, and have raised the issue of waitlists
for and lack of access to mental health services for youth, the potential burden of adult mental health
issues on children, post-partum depression, and Kids Help Phone. Liberal members have stressed
investments the government is making in improving mental health of Canadians, including for youth.
During FEWO’s current study, members have asked about gender gaps in suicide rates, making mental
health supports more accessible to vulnerable populations, best practices to support organizations,
transitional programs for youth, national standards, early interventions, and a prenatal mental health
strategy. NDP members have raised during FEWO’s study on mental health issues of stigmatization of
women in girls, as well as eating disorders, anxiety, post-partum depression, and police response to
mental health crises. The BQ have asked about the Kids Help Phone during FEWO’s current study.
o Sexual and Reproductive Health: Liberal members have supported investments made in
increased access to menstrual products for women and girls, as well as increased access to sexual and
reproductive health services, including abortion. The BQ have raised the impact of a woman’s right and
ability to choose abortion, as well as their dress (in relation to Quebec’s Bill C-21) on their mental health.
o Nutrition: CPC MPs have focused on inflation and high food prices. They may tie in high food
prices to difficulty achieving a healthy diet. Liberal members have also supported healthy eating and
physical activity to support children and youth and prevent juvenile diabetes, and have asked about
eating disorders during FEWO’s current study on mental health. The BQ has supported measures to ban
sweetened alcoholic beverages, following the death of Québec teen, Athéna Gervais.
o HHR Crisis, Backlogs, and Access to Healthcare: CPC and LPC members have raised the issue of
backlogs in procedures and treatments due to the pandemic, as well asthe potential burden of the
mental health of frontline workers on their families. The NDP members, during FEWO’s current study,
have raised issues of access to pre-natal care in rural areas.
o Healthcare Funding: CPC members have posed questions during the FEWO Study on the Mental
Health of Young Women and Girls about modernizing health care, allocation of funding for mental
health, and increased funding for programs for self and co-regulation. They have also expressed concern
over a lack of action on mental health transfers. During FEWO, the BQ have called for additional funding
for community organizations that support the mental health of women and girls and have raised issues
of jurisdiction and health transfers. NDP members have raised issues of healthcare funding during
FEWO’s study on mental health, especially for Indigenous populations. They have also questioned
whether the Canada Health Act needs to be updated in terms of inclusivity for mental health issues.
o Addictions: CPC members have called for investments in the mental health system, including
those suffering from addiction. During FEWO meetings on the Study of the Mental Health of Young
Women and Girls, members have asked questions regarding the intervention times to stop addiction
disorders,as well as the relationship between cannabis and mental health. NDP members have noted
the correlation between substance use and decriminalization during FEWO’s current study.
o Tobacco: The NDP had called for amendments to Bill S-5, Act to amend the Tobacco Act in 2018
to prohibit all vaping flavours that could be appealing to youth.
o MAID: The CPC has raised the topic of MAID during the FEWO Study on the Mental Health of
Young Women and Girls.
The Portfolio has prepared a range of briefing products,highlighting federal support and initiatives that
would benefit Canadians, including women and girls. This includes proposed measures to improve
mental health, to address substance use, and to access to health services focused on key health
priorities (including mental health and addiction services, backlogs/health human resources, and
primary care/virtual care), as well as regulatory and other measures.
BACKGROUNDER ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG WOMEN AND GIRLS
Appearance before theStanding Committee on the Status of Women (FEWO)
The following provides an overview of key trends and data in relation to the mental health of women
and girls.
MENTAL HEALTH
Positive Mental Health in Girls and Young Women
Summary: There were decreases in self-reported excellent/very good mental health over recent years
for both young women and girls, and lower rates of self-reported excellent/very good mental health
compared to male peers in recent years. Girls were more likely to report low life satisfaction, and were
considered to have more problematic social media use than their male peers.
Young women
• The percentage of young women aged 18-34 years who reported “excellent” or “very good”
mental health fell from 56% in 2019 to 46% in 2021.1
• Youngwomen aged 18-34 years were less likely than young men of the same age to report
“excellent” or “very good” mental health before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 (56% vs. 66%,
respectively) and during the pandemic in 2021 (46% vs, 56%, respectively).1
• In late 2021/early 2022, 46% of young women aged 18-34 years old reported that their mental
health was “somewhat worse now” or “much worse now” compared to before the pandemic started.2
• Over a fifth (22%) of girls and young women aged 15-24 yearsreported feeling lonely “always”
or “often” in early 2022.3
Girls
• Girls aged 11-15 years in 2018 were more likely than boys of the same age to be classified as
having problematic social media usage (8% vs. 5%, respectively). Problematic social media usage was
associated with a lower likelihood of high life satisfaction among both girls and boys.4
• Girls aged 11-15 years were more likely than boys of the same age to report low life satisfaction
from 2002 to 2018, with inequality in low life satisfactionby gender increasing over these years.5
• The percentage of girls aged 12-17 years who reported “excellent” or “very good” mental health
fell from 67% in 2019 to 52% in 2021.1
• Girls aged 12-17 years were less likely than boys of the same age to report “excellent” or “very
good” mental health before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 (67% vs. 79%, respectively) and during the
pandemic in 2021 (52% vs, 72%, respectively).1
• In late 2021/early 2022, 38% of girls aged 12-17 years old reported that their mental health was
“somewhat worse now” or “much worse now” compared to before the pandemic started, which was
higher than the percentage of boys (22%).2
Visits to emergency rooms and hospitalization
Summary: In comparison to male peers, young women had more emergency room visits, are more likely
to be hospitalized for anxiety and depression, or for eating disorders (particularly those aged 15-19)
(2021-22).
• Emergency room visits by young women for anxiety and depression in 2021-2022 are 2 to 4
times higher thantheir male peers, depending on the age group and diagnosis. Young women aged 15-
19 and 20-24 visit the ER for anxiety or depression at the highest rates among all age groups (175 to 177
visits per 100,000 population).6
• In addition, young women and girlsstarting from age 10 are more likely to be hospitalized for
anxiety or depression than their male peers. In 2021-2022, females aged 10-14 were hospitalized at a
rate 6.2 times higher than their male peers for depression in 2021 (37.2 discharges per 100,000
population as compared to 6.0 discharges per 100,000 population), and 4.7 times higher than their male
peers for anxiety (42.5 discharges per 100,000 population as compared to 8.95 discharges per 100,000
population). This pattern of increased risk of hospitalization due to depression or anxiety holds for
young women 15-19 and 20-24, with rates 2.4 to 3.2 timeshigher than their male peers.7
• The population of young women and girls in Canada is also one that is largely overrepresented
among those hospitalized for eating disorders. From age 10-19, young women and girls are hospitalized
for eating disorders at a rate 10 times that of their male peers, reaching 21.2 hospitalizations per
100,000 population for those aged 15-19 in 2021-2022. This rate drops sharply for those aged 20-25 and
25+, highlighting the need for care among female youth.8
Medication Use
Summary: In comparison to their male peers, there were increased rates in medication dispensation for
young women and girls (2016-21).
• Rates of dispensation of mood and anxiety medication suggest that the pandemic has affected
young women and girls more dramatically than their male peers. While dispensation of these
medications has increased in all age-sex groupings from 2016-2021, a disproportionate increase was
seen for females in all but the youngest (5-9) age category, ascompared to their male peers.9
• Dispensation of antipsychotics has also disproportionately increased among young women from
2020-2021. In all age groups with the exception of children (5-9), an increase in the rate of antipsychotic
dispensation was seen from 2020-2021 for young women, while the rate remained stable for young
men.9
Suicide and self-harm for girls and young women
Summary: In recent decades, suicide mortality rates for young women and girls have increased. Young
females had higher hospitalization rates associated with self-harm injury and greater rates of reported
suicidal ideation than older adults.
Suicide mortality
• From 2017 to 2019, there was approximately 360deaths by suicide per year in Canada for
females aged 10-34; corresponding to suicide rate of 6.4 per 100,000 females (4.9 per 100,000 girls aged
10-19 years old, and 7.1 per 100,000 young women aged 21-34 years old).10
• From 2017 to 2019, suicide was the2th leading cause of death among girls aged 15-24 years old
and 2nd or 3rd leading cause of death for young women aged 25-34 years old.11
• Suicide mortality rate for females aged 10-24 years old had significantly increases in recent
decades.12
• Mortality rate of suicide by suffocation, hanging or strangulation for females aged 10-19 years
and 20-34 years old had continuing significantly increases in the past four decades.13
Self-harm hospitalization
• Young females had much higherhospitalization rates associated with self-harm injury than
young males at the same age and older adults.
o In the 2020-2021 fiscal year, the hospitalization rate associated with self-harm injury was 187
per 100,000 girls aged 10-19 years old (vs. 43 per 100,000 boys aged 10-19 years old), and 102 per
100,000 young women aged 20-34 years old (vs. 61 per 100,000 young men), compared to 61 per
100,000 population for all age and sex combined in Canada.14
Suicidal ideation
• Younger females were more likely toreport suicidal ideation compared to older adults.
o In 2019, 5.6% females aged 18-34 years old reported suicidal ideation in the past 12 months,
compared to 2.8% among all females aged 18 and older in Canada.15
o During the pandemic, 5.2% and 7.9% females aged 18-34 years reported suicidal ideation since
the COVID-19 pandemic began in fall 2020 and spring 2021 respectively, compared to 2.7% and 4.0%
among females aged 18 and older in Canada.15-17
• There was no significantly differences on reporting suicidal ideation between young females and
males aged 18-34 years.15-17
• Female youths aged 15-17 years old were two times more likely to report suicidal ideation
compared to male youths aged 15-17 years old.
o During 2019 and 2020, 8.2% girls aged 15 to 17years reported suicidal ideation in the past 12
month, compared to 4.2% for boys at the same age, [9,10] and 2.7% for all adults aged 18 and older in
2019.15,17
Access to integrated youth services by youth
• As of August 31, 2020, 7,539 youth had sought help from, or been connected with ACCESS Open
Minds services. 53% of those youths were cis-female and 35% were LGBTWIA2S+. For young people
seeking help from ACCESS Open Minds services, there were statistically significant reductions in distress
and severityof mental health problems, and improvements in mental health and school, work and social
functioning. 67% of young people who received services at ACCESS Open Minds had higher mental
health scores and 65.5% had lower severity of mental health problems.
INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE (IPV) EXPERIENCED BY YOUNG WOMEN (aged 15 to 24 years)
Summary: Over half (56%) of young women in an intimate partner relationship reported experiencing
IPV at least once since age 15. Approximately one third of victims of police-reported violence in 2019
were victimized by an intimate partner. Young women who had experienced abuse or harsh parenting
by the age of 15 were also more likely to have experienced IPV than those who did not have those early
experiences. Child and youthvictims of violence were more commonly girls (57%).
In 2018, of young women aged 15 to 24 who had ever been in an intimate partner relationship18:
• 56% reported experiencing some form of IPV at least once since age 15 (43% among ever-
partnered women aged25 years and older).
• 29% experienced some form of IPV in the previous 12 months (10% among women aged 25
years and older).
• 5% of reported being sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months (1%
among women aged 25 years and older).
• 6% reported being physically assaulted by an intimate partner in the previous 12 months (2%
among women aged 25 years and older).
• 28% reported being emotionally, financially or psychologically abused by an intimate partner in
the previous 12 months (10% among women aged 25 years and older).
• 25% of visible minority women experienced some form of IPV in the previous 12 months (7%
among visible minoritywomen aged 25 years and older).
Police-reported IPV (2019)
• In 2019, the 358,244 victims of police-reported violence in Canada, three in ten (30%) were
victimized by an intimate partner19.
o 39% of all female victims of violence aged 15-24 years were victimized by an intimate partner
(compared to 8% of men in the same age group).
o The majority (30%)of these female victims of violence were victimized by a dating partner.
Childhood maltreatment and IPV among young women (aged 15 to 24 years) in 2018
• Among young women who had been physically or sexually abused at least once before age 15,
72% experienced some form of IPV in their lifetime (compared to 50% of those who had never
experienced childhood abuse).18
• Young women who reported experiencing harsh parenting at least once before age 15 were also
more likely than those who had never experienced harsh parenting to report experiencing IPV (62% and
43%, respectively).18
Police reported child maltreatment
• In 2019, there were 69,691 child and youth victims of police-reported violence in Canada 0-17
years, and victims were more commonly girls (57%).19
o One-third (32%) of children and youth who were victims of violence that came to the attention
of police were victimized by a family member. This represented 22,299 child and youth victims of family
violence and, again, a larger proportion of victims were girls (60%).19
o Within the family, child and youth victims were most often victimized by a parent (60%) while a
sibling (15%) was less common.19
SUBSTANCE USE
Smoking and Vaping
Summary: In terms of recent trends smoking continues to decline and is at an all-time low of 2% of
women aged 15-19 and vaping has been stable since 2021.
A survey (COMPASS) of high school students in Ontario, BC, Alberta and Quebec in 2017/18 found:
• Students who use substances report greater symptoms of mental health challenges (anxiety,
depression or both)
• Female high school students who reported symptoms of both anxiety and depression were at
the highest risk of engaging in polysubstance use
• Of the females who engage in polysubstance use, 72% reported symptoms of depression anxiety
or both compared with 42% of male students
According to the Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine Survey (CTNS) 2021:
• Among women aged 15-19, 13% reported vaping in the past 30 days, compared with 13% of
men in this age group,
• Among women aged 20-24, 14% reported vaping the past 30 days, compared with 20% of men
in this age group.
According to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2021:
• Current smoking among women aged 15-19 was unreportable due to small sample size
compared with 3% of men in this age group.
• Among women aged 20-24, 9%* reported currently smoking compared with 12% of men in this
age group (*moderate sampling variability interpret with caution).
Cannabis Use
Summary: 18% of high school students (males and females) reported cannabis use in 2018-19.
• Past year use of cannabis was greater among male respondents (51% males; 46% females).20
• In 2018-19, 18% of students ingrades 7 to 12 (approximately 374,000) reported using cannabis
in the year preceding the survey, unchanged from 2016-17. Past-12-month use of cannabis by both
males and females was 18%, unchanged from the previous cycle.21
• Women aged 15 to 24 experiencedthe largest average annual increase in the rate of
hospitalizations due to cannabis harms (12.2% per year, 95% CI 11.5 to 12.8).22
Substance and alcohol use
Summary: Rates of hospitalizations for harm caused by substance use were higher in female youth than
males in 2017-18. Alcohol is the most used substance by youth (2018-19). Female post-secondary
students drank less frequently, had lower rates of use of illegal substances than male students, but had
higher rates of psychoactive pharmaceutical use (2019-20). Hospitalizations for opioid and stimulant-
related poisonings were higher for girls than boys (0-19 yrs) but accidental apparent opioid toxicity
deaths were higher for boys (2018-21).
• A 2019 report from the Canadian Institutes for Health Information (CIHI) showed that rates of
hospitalizations for harm caused by substance use rose steeply in 2017-2018 in female youth between
the ages of 12 and 16 and were higher among females compared with males. The report also showed
that among youth hospitalized for harm caused by substance use, a higher proportion of females (72%)
than males (66%) received care for a mental health condition.23
• Alcohol remains the substance with the highest prevalence of use by Canadian youth in grades 7
to 12, 2018-19 data from the Canadian Student, Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey showed that 45% of
females reported alcohol use in the past 12 months (higher than males at 43%). 7% of all students, both
male and female, reported using illegal drugs to get high. The survey also showed that in grades 7-12,
girls have similar patterns to boys in terms cannabis use (18% in both).21
• Data from the 2019/2020 school year showed that in thepast 12 months, 12% of female
students in Canadian Postsecondary institutions reported use of any illegal drug, however, this was
lower than male students (18%). Female university or college students also drank less frequently their
male counterparts, asmeasured over a 30 day recall period. The proportion drinking at least once a
week was 35% among females compared to 46% among males. Further, female students (16%) were
less likely than males (24%) to report frequent heavy drinking at least once a week. Female students
reported higher rates of psychoactive pharmaceuticaluse than males (40% vs 32%).20
• The total number of opioid and stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations among girls aged 0-
19 years was consistently higher compared to their male counterparts. Between 2018-2021, girls aged 0-
19 years experienced fewer accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths compared to boys of the same
age.24
IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON WOMEN’S MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased mental health challenges and substance-related
harms for many Canadians, particularly women.Policy responses to pandemics, such as isolation and
lockdowns, exacerbate issues. The stigma of substance use—including self-stigma and community
stigma—presents a key barrier to women seeking support. Disruption in services for women who use
substances has negative consequences (e.g., reduced access to feminine hygiene products, less social
support including for women with children and for 2SLGBTQ+ people), and a range of measures must be
developed to ensure access to a continuum of harm reduction andtreatment services. Disasters, such as
the COVID-19 pandemic, are associated with a rise in intimate partner violence, which contribute to the
development of post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues. Related mental health
conditions such asdepression and trauma require ongoing service support.
• Mental health-related disability has increased among employed Canadians during pandemic,
particularly among young women.25
o The proportion of employed women aged 16 to 24 years with mental health-related disability
was 17.2% in 2021. This was an increase of 7.6 percentage points from 2019, the largest increase of all
major demographic groups.
o Among employed young men in the same age group, just under 1 in 10 (8.9%) had a mental
health-related disability in 2021, which was consistent with 2019 data.
o For those in the core working ages (25 to 54 years), employed women had a higher prevalence
of mental health-related disability in 2021 (13.0%; +4.7 percentage points from 2019) than their male
counterparts (6.5%; +1.6 percentage points from 2019).
• Mental health declines have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, 59% of Canadians
aged 12+ years reported very good or excellent mental health, compared with 67.1% in 2019. The
decline is greateramong females (-9.4 percentage points) compared with males (-6.7 percentage
points).26
• Physician-based outpatient mental health care in Ontario increased during the pandemic,
accompanied by a large, rapid shift to virtual care. There was a disproportionate increase in use of
mental health care services among adolescent females.27
• Almost one in four women (24%) screened positive for at least one disorder, including major
depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, compared with 17%
of men, according to the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health from September to December 2020.28
• Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) conducted a series of national surveys, the
most recent of which (the week of January 7th 2022) showed that, 25.1% of respondents indicated
moderate to severe anxiety levels in the past week. There was a significant gender gap, with 28.8% of
women versus 20.9% of men reporting moderate to severe anxiety. Moreover, 24.1 percent reported
feelings of loneliness in the past week. Again there was a significant gender gap, with 27.8% of women
feeling lonely compared to 19.5% of men. 29
• Using data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, researchers found:30
o From September to December 2020, the prevalence of self-reported increased alcohol use
(16.2% women; 15.2% men) and cannabis use (4.9% women; 5.8% men) compared to before COVID-19
was similar between men and women.
o For both genders, higher income, non-racialized group membership, working in the past week,
being a parent/legal guardian of a child aged under 18 and screening positive for symptoms of major
depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder were associated with increased alcohol use.
o Men and women who were between theages of 18 to 44 and those who screened positive for
major depressive disorder, were more likely to report increased cannabis use during COVID-19. Men
with symptoms of general anxiety disorder were more likely to report increased cannabis use.
o For women, postsecondary education was significantly associated with increased alcohol use
compared to less than high school. For men, being a parent/legal guardian was significantly associated
with lower odds of increased cannabis use.
• Two integrated youth services (IYS) networks in Canada ((Foundry in BC [Dr. Steven Mathias &
Dr. Skye Barbic] and Youth Wellness Hubs Ontario [Dr. Joanna Henderson & Dr. Debbie Chiodo]) recently
conducted an analysis of IYS data to assess the mental healthand substance use needs of girls & young
women in the context of COVID-19. The unpublished analysis found that the majority of girls/young
women presenting for youth services are experiencing high levels of mental health challenges, and these
challenges have become worse over the course of the pandemic. Based on data collected from more
than 7000 girls and young women who accessed either Foundry or YWHO (2021-2022) approximately
65% of girls/young women are experiencing severe psychological distress. An additional third of the
girls/young women are experiencing moderately severe psychological distress.
• The analysis assessed a number of areas of mental health, including depression, anxiety, eating
disorder-related concerns and substance use. In all areas women and girls mental health have worsened
since the start of the pandemic. In addition, the study looked specifically at the mental health of gender
diverse youth and found that the majority of gender diverse youth are experiencing very high levels of
mental health challenges, and these challenges have become worse over the course of the pandemic.
Based on data from more than 250 gender diverse youth from YWHO, 70% of gender diverse youth are
experiencing severe psychological distress.

Current Health Portfolio Funding –Young Women and Girls
Investments/Activities to support the Mental Health of Children and Youth
• The Government of Canada provides funding though bilateral agreements to provinces/
territories, ($5 billion over 10 years from 2017-2027) to expand access to mental health and addictions
services, including community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth. For
many provinces/territories, this takes the form of support for integrated youth services.
• The Government of Canada is also investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk
and protective factors to promote mental health for children, youth and other populations experiencing
mental health inequities through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion
Innovation Fund (MHP-IF).
o PHAC also funds programming to prevent teen and youth dating violence, and initiatives to
support the health of survivors of family violence, including trauma-informed physical and mental health
promotion for youth (see below).
• In response to the pandemic, to date, Health Canada has invested $270 million in Wellness
Together Canada, an online mental health andsubstance use support portal.
o Through the Portal, childrenand youth (ages 5 to 29) are also able to access mental health and
substance use resources, including Kids Help Phone, which provides online, phone and text based
support to young people who are in crisis or dealing with mental health issues.
• Budget 2021 provided $45 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, the
Public Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to help develop national
mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces andterritories, health organizations,
and key stakeholders.
o As a key element of this work, Health Canada is funding Standards Council of Canada to
coordinate the development of an integrated suite of national standards for mental health and
substance use services in priority areas that align with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities (CSOP), which includes Integrated Youth Services.
• An additional $14.8M is being provided directly to Kids Help Phone over 36 months from April
2020to March 2023) so it can continue to provide mental health support to youth in need during the
pandemic.
• Children and youth are among the populations that will benefit from Budget 2021 investments
of $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those most affected by the pandemic.

Project Title: Pubertal development and mental health in the 3D Cohort Study: Key biological,
sociocultural and environmental correlates of puberty and their longitudinal association with mental
health outcomes in boys and girls
Project Description: Puberty is a complex process that involves vast changes in hormones, sexual
maturation, identity formation and social interactions. Scientific discoveries have been critical to
understanding the onset and normative progression of puberty, its hormonal underpinnings, and its
association with mental health (MH) in youth. However, despite this very promising research, puberty is
recognized only very generally in public health and prevention programs, and is rarely considered in the
identification of children most at risk and in program delivery. This may be due in part to the complexity
of measuring pubertal development and all its components and the fact that certain aspects of pubertal
development are still not well understood, especially in boys. To address this, we began to measure the
puberty and social environment of children that had been followed since birth in the context of a large
pregnancy cohort study (3D study). This new study aims to further measure these children's puberty,
hormones, key psychosocial and social environment factors, and mental health into adolescence, a key
period for the development of mental health. We can then use our data to identify which pubertal
profiles and social environment characteristics are important to youth's mental health and test whether
puberty and these psychosocial and social environment factors interact to increase or reduce MH
problems. This will then guide how, when and for whom to aim prevention.

Project Title: Reducing Maternal Perinatal Mental Health Problems in Times of Service Shortage: A web
and telephone-based Intervention
Project Description: Women of child bearing age have had the largest increase in anxiety and depressive
disorders of all age groups since the onset of the pandemic (Lancet, 10/21). As documented in over 300
studies and 15 meta-analyses, maternal mental health issues exert a toll on mother, family, and
newborn. In Canada, pregnant women have reported levels of depression 2-3 times higher than pre-
pandemic levels. In Québec, >19 000 persons are on the government waiting list for receiving mental
health services. Offering effective population-based prevention programs to deal with mental health
problems-a wider impact of COVID-19 pandemic-is thus moreimportant than ever in a context where
curative/therapeutic services are lacking. To advance mental healthcare among a high-risk population,
we will test the efficacy of a virtual care intervention (telephone-based) initiated early in pregnancy to
preventpostpartum depression at 2 and 6 months after childbirth (points of peak prevalence). The
Parents & Babies intervention comprises 8 online modules and 10 telephone sessions by a trained
coach. Participants' partners are encouraged to take part in the intervention. This randomized
controlled trial will enroll 510 Quebec women with mild to moderate depression from diverse
socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The project will maximize health benefits within a rapid
response timeframe by 1) providing timelyweb-based and telephone support; 2) potentially prevent
maternal depression, anxiety and child development issues associated with maternal mental health
problems; 3) identify a potentially effective and cost-effective model of preventive care to ameliorate
the wider negative impacts of COVID-19; 4) by comparing RCT data to our 3 ongoing perinatal mental
health observational studies, generate new knowledge on the indirect and wider consequences of
COVID-19 on maternal and child health.

Project Title: Understanding the Wider Health and Equity Impacts of Public Health COVID-19 Mitigation
Strategies on Young Mothers, Children and Youth Living in Cities
Project Description: The public health response to COVID-19 involved strategies to prevent person-to-
person spread of the virus so that hospitals would not become overwhelmed with severely ill cases.
These strategiesincluded prolonged restrictions to social interaction, school and day care closures and
substantial job loss in large sectors of the economy. There are concerns that disruptions to these social
and economic activities could have profound health impacts in vulnerable populations. There is a
growing recognition that urban life has important implications for health and that the built environment,
neighborhood structure and social resources of cities can increase resilience or exacerbate inequities.
This project will focus on measuring the broader impacts of COVID-19 public health containment
strategies on a range of mental health, drug use and domestic violence outcomes in mothers of young
children, children and youth that could be a product of the anxiety, depression, and a sense of
hopelessness that is associated with loss of social interaction, education and employment that came
with COVID-19 containment strategies. These outcomes will be measured using proven existing methods
based on health system data, The study will draw on census data to measure important aspects of urban
structure, labour force survey data to look at job loss, mobility data from cell phones to look at broad
aspects of urban social interaction and publicly available data on urban school and day care closures.
This study brings together a multi-disciplinary research team with extensive expertise in using these
data. The results of this study on the association between public health mitigation and adverse
outcomes mediated through urban structures and supports will help us to develop strategies to make
cities more resilient and to inform our efforts to allow cities to recover from COVID-19 in a way that is
fair and equitable and that serves the needs of children, youth, and mothers of young children.

Project Title: Transdiagnostic internet cognitive-behavior therapy for mixed anxiety and depressive
symptoms in postnatal women: A randomized controlled trial
Project Description: Anxiety and depressive symptoms are common during pregnancy and the year
following childbirth, and perinatal women experience barriers in access to evidence-based
psychotherapy. COVID-19 is expected to put a strain on the already fragile mental health system, as
early reports reveal depression and anxiety have been on the rise. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) is
the most evidence-based psychotherapy for anxiety and depression. The MUMentum internet-delivered
CBT (iCBT) program for perinatal anxiety and depression was developed in Australia. In the current
study, we propose to conduct a French adaptation of the iCBT program, and to examine the
acceptability and efficacyof the postnatal component of the intervention. The study will be carried out
in primary care settings in Quebec and Ontario. Participants with anxiety and depressive symptoms will
self-refer to iCBT. The program will be implemented on a virtual clinic atUniversity of Sherbrooke. An
accessible low intensity iCBT postnatal intervention in French could contribute to the mental health of
women, as well as reduce adverse outcomes for mother and child. Positive outcomes of the trial would
provide important evidence-based data to support adoption of iCBT in routine perinatal care and the
scaling-up of the intervention in Canada.

Project Title: A Randomized Clinical Trial of At-Home Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for
Depression in Pregnancy
Project Description: Major depression affects up to 10% of pregnant women. Untreated or
undertreated, it can have negative and long-lasting effects on a pregnant woman and her developing
child. Standard depression treatments such as psychotherapy and medication are not ideal in
pregnancy. Psychotherapies require time to take effect, and work less well for severe depression.
Antidepressant drugs can improve symptoms in weeks, but there are concerns, not unfounded, about
their safety for the fetus, limiting desire for use by patients and physicians. There is evidence that as few
as 20% of pregnant women with depression receive adequate care for their illness. Transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS) is an effective localized brain stimulation treatment for depression that
changes brain activity specifically in the area of the brain targeting depression, so it poses no theoretical
risk to a developing fetus. The tDCS equipment is affordable and portable, and women can be trained in
its use for self-administration at-home. So, if it is shown to be safe and effective, there is significant
potential for it to be widely used. In our pilot study, pregnant women's views of tDCS werevery positive,
and there was no evidence of impact on the developing fetus. Furthermore, women receiving tDCS had
fewer depressive symptoms after 3 weeks of treatment than women receiving a placebo treatment-
and after delivery, they had a lower risk ofremaining depressed postpartum. We now propose a large
trial to definitively evaluate tDCS as a treatment for depression in pregnancy, recruiting over 150
women, and following them and their children to evaluate the impact of tDCS on maternal and child
health during pregnancy and until 1 year postpartum. We expect that this trial will provide evidence for
a strategy around treatment of depression in pregnancy that could reach a large number of women in
Canada and beyond, and promote positive health outcomes in this vulnerable maternal-child
population.

Project Title: Traumatic Brain Injury and Perinatal Mental Health Outcomes
Project Description: In Canada, 2% of the population lives with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and there
are 18,000 hospitalizations for TBI each year. One-third of persons with TBI are women, and TBI is
common in young women entering their childbearing years. Women with TBI are more likely than men
to have mental health problems post-injury. Yet, little is known about their mental health around the
time of pregnancy. This is an important issue because women with TBI may be uniquely at risk for new
or worsening mental illness in pregnancy and the postpartum period because of stressors related to
sleep deprivation and sensory issues, and the impact of hormonal changes on a vulnerable brain. Our
goals are to examine the burden of mental illness among women with TBI before, during, and after
pregnancy and the risks of medical problems in the mother and baby during and after pregnancy among
women with co-occurring TBI and perinatal mental illness. We will use data collected from Ontario
health records to identify all women with a livebirth or stillbirth conceived in 2002-2019. We will
compare women with a history of TBI before pregnancy, and those with no such history, on their risks of
mental illness diagnoses, mental health service use patterns, and risks of severe mental health
outcomes such as self-harm or suicide before, during, and after pregnancy. We will also examine the
risks of maternal and newborn medical complications associated with having both TBI and perinatal
mental illness. Evidence of an association between TBI and mental illness around the time of pregnancy
will lead to the development of health care services that address the unique mental health needs of
women with TBI. Given that TBI is a leading cause of disability worldwide, these efforts will result in
better outcomes for mothers, infants, and families by providing more responsive support to women

Project Title:Impact of Infertility and its Treatment on Women's Mental Health
Project Description: Mental illness, especially perinatal depression affects about 10% of women during
and around pregnancy. However, while about 15% of reproductive-aged women suffer from infertility,
and many turn to infertility treatment to achieve pregnancy, we do not know as much about the mental
health needs of these women. In this study, we will describe the relationship between infertility,
infertility treatment, and mental illness ina Canadian population. We will measure how often infertile
women who received infertility treatment experienced mental illness. We will compare the
development of mental illnesses among women who became pregnant with infertility treatment with
women who became pregnant without infertility treatment, and also to women who attempted
pregnancy with infertility treatment but were not successful. In addition to looking at newly arising
mental illness, we will also measure which women had previously existing mental illnesses before they
received infertility treatment. We will use information gathered from health-related databases for
women in Ontario from 2006 until 2017. To determine which women were infertile, we will look in
records for either an infertility-related diagnosis or use of infertility treatment. To measure mental
illness, we will look in records for visits to a physician, hospital, or emergency department for mental
illness, self-harm, or a record of suicide. Infertility and its treatment are both rising in Canada, and it is
unclear how these trends are affecting women's mental health. Results from our study can help guide
and customize fertility treatment and can also help in planning mental health support for women who
have fertility problems.

Project Title: Randomized Controlled Trial of an Electronic Patient Decision Aid (PDA) for Antidepressant
Medication Use in Pregnancy
Project Description: Major depressive disorder is a debilitating and often chronic mental illness that
affects 1 in 5 women over the lifespan. When depression is not treated effectively during pregnancy, the
mother's and her child's health is at risk. Antidepressant medications are a mainstay of treatment for
women whose depression is severe, or not adequately responsive to psychotherapy. Yet, it is very hard
to determine when risks for relapse/ongoing depression definitely outweigh the small, but still uncertain
risks of antidepressants. So, treatment decisions regarding antidepressant use in pregnancy must be
guided not only by evidence about harms and benefits, but also by: (1) how a woman values the
potential benefits and harms of the treatment options; (2) which option she prefers; and (3) the extent
to which she wants to be involved in the treatment decision. Women have significant difficulty making
this decision, but want to be active in decision-making. We designed an interactive electronic PDA to
help women with depression make decisions about whether or not to use antidepressant medication in
pregnancy, and successfully pilot-tested it with women across Canada. We now propose a randomized
controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the online PDA in women with depression who are
pregnancy-planning or in the early stages of pregnancy and facing decisions about use of
antidepressants in pregnancy. The primary focus of the trial will be on whether the PDA can optimize
decision-making effectively, as measured by the prevention of postpartum depression(PPD) since this
clinical outcome is most directly linked to both ineffective management of depression in pregnancy, and
to long-term negative impact for mothers and children.

Project Title: Assessing the role of adolescent hormonal contraceptive use on risk for depression
Project Description: Young women in Canada often use hormonal contraception (HC), and its popularity
is increasing. The use of HC is highly effective in preventing teenage pregnancies and has a number of
positive societal and economic consequences. However, HC was originally developed as a medication for
adults, and much remains unknown about the potential side effects for teenagers of using HC.For
example, because adolescence is a life stage during which major brain development is still ongoing, use
of HC during this period could have effects on brain development with long-lasting consequences on
young women's mental health. Our proposed research builds upon the growing evidence that
relationships may exist between the synthetic hormones that are contained in HC, patterns of brain
development, and mental functioning. We will conduct a three-year study of young women aged 13-18,
documenting theiruse of HC during this period along with their stress reactivity, social competence, and
depression symptoms. Thus, our study is designed to examine not only whether young women who use
HC are at increased risk for developing depression, but also why sucha relationship might exist, and
which women may be particularly sensitive to such side effects of using HC. Women are approximately
twice as likely as men to develop depression in their lives. Depression is a leading cause of years lived
with disability and reduced quality of life, unemployment and lost wages, and risk for suicide. We expect
that our research will advance scientific understanding about why women might be at particular risk for
developing these disorders. We also hope that our research willcontribute new data relevant to an
important ongoing conversation in the medical community and in the public about the prescription of
HC to adolescent women, ultimately promoting more informed dialogue and decision-making.

Project Title: Gender inequalities in adolescent mental health in Canada
Project Description: During early childhood, boys and girls have similar mental health experiences. By
adolescence, gaps start to appear for mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression are diagnosed
more commonly among girls, while for boys, risk-taking behaviours and fatal outcomes such as suicide
pose greater risks. These are examples of "gender-based mental health inequalities",and we want to
focus here on the deep reasons why they exist. Using survey data and young people's own stories, we
want to understand: (1) how individual behaviours and social processes (such as use of social media,
available peer and adult supports, and risk-taking) contribute to mental health inequalities between
adolescent boys and girls; (2) how differences in mental health between boys and girls are shaped by
gendered differences in their social backgrounds. We will bring together new analyses of health survey
data with information from a series of interviews with young Canadians. Integration of all study findings
will provide new evidence about factors that effect mental health among groups of adolescents, inform
interventions, and enrich the evidencebase for health policy. This project is especially timely because
the mental health of Canadian adolescents, as well as gender-based inequalities, have emerged as two
very pressing social challenges in our country.

BACKGROUND
KEY FACTS
• Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health of Canadians was in decline and needs were
increasing. Positive mental health declined between 2009 and 2019, especially for children and youth,
63% of whom reported excellent or very good mental health in 2019 compared to 77% in 2009. 68% of
adults reportedexcellent or very good mental health in 2019 compared to 73% in 2009. During this
time, there was also an increase in Canadians reporting having been diagnosed with depression or an
anxiety disorder. For youth, these diagnoses doubled, increasing from 7% to 15% in 2019, and for adults
they increased from 10% in 2009 to 13% in 2019.
• The pandemic has further emphasized the need for increased mental health care. Positive
mental health further declined throughout the pandemic, with only 60% of adults and 54% of children
and youth reporting excellent or very good mental health in 2021. In fall 2020, one in five Canadians
reported a need for mental health care in the past year. Of those, 45% reported that their needs were
either unmet or only partially met. A delay in mental health support is linked to decreased positive
health outcomes, therefore timely support is particularly important.
• Among other priority populations, Canadian youth, Indigenous and those identifying as
LGBTIA2+ report greated need for mental health care than adults, non-Indigenous Canadians and those
not identifying as LGBTQIA2+. Of those who need care, these groups are also more likely to report that
their needs are unmet or partially met.
The mental health needs of Canadians and priority populations (e.g., youth, Indigenous populations,
racialized and LGBTQ2S+ communities), which were increasing pre-pandemic, have been further
exacerbated by the pandemic. Moreover, persistent barriers to care remain and have worsened during
this time. Some of these barriers include variability in service availability, fragmented care (i.e., lack of
integration between mental health care/primary care/other services), lack of equitable access to care,
including virtual care options, lack of culturallysensitive/appropriate services, lack of capacity and
stigma.
These barriers have put increased strain on the healthcare system (e.g., increase in number of
individuals in mental health crisis going to Emergency Departments for care). The pandemic is not yet
over and experts predict that its impact will be felt for many years, if not decades to come.
Ongoing and pandemic-response measures while generally effective are not sufficient to address the
increased demand and barriers. More support is needed toensure that the mental health needs of
Canadians are addressed while the strain on the health care system is lessened. Given this the
government appointed the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. She is working to ensure that
mental health is treated as a full and equal part of the universal healthcare system and that health
equities are understood and addressed.
Ongoing Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health and addictions services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via
negotiated bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and
addiction services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread
proven models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to
primary health services.
Agreements outlining how provinces and territories applied federal investment over the first five years
expired in March 2022. Work has begun to implement one-year extensions of the agreements, which
provide provinces and territoriesthe opportunity to evaluate current needs and adjust priorities as they
plan for the remaining four years of targeted funding.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use Services
Budget 2021 provided $45 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, the Public
Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to help develop national
mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations,
and key stakeholders.
On March 14, 2022, Health Canada announced a partnership with Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to
develop national standards for mental health and substance use services, to help fulfil commitments
made in Budget 2021. Standards will be evidence-based and developed through consensus-based
processes that engage experts, health organizations, people with lived and living experience, and other
key stakeholders. Standards are tools for supporting health providers in the delivery of high-quality and
equitable mental health and substance use services, and will help to ensure a consistent level of care is
provided. They will also help to formalize what Canadians can expect in terms of the quality of services,
while providing an evidence-based framework for service delivery in priority areas.
SCC is coordinating the development of an integrated suite of national standards for mental health and
substance use services in priority areas that align with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities (CSOP). The Government has emphasized the importance of engagement with diverse
stakeholders and promotion of health equity principles, which have been incorporated into the
development process.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020,the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youthduring the COVID-19 pandemic.
$9 million is being provided to the United Way (through New Horizons) for practical services forseniors.
The Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund is investing $10 million to support
community-based projects across Canada.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding will support the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.
Suicide Prevention
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recently announced that it
will adopt 9-8-8 for Canadians to call or text when in need of immediate mental health crisis and suicide
prevention support. This will be launched across Canada on November 30, 2023.
In parallel, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is preparing for implementation of a three-digit
number for suicide prevention from a service delivery perspective. On August 31, 2022, PHAC
announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) was selected tolead coordination
of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experience delivering Talk Suicide Canada. As a first step, CAMH
will develop collaborations with key organizations to start building capacity, and engage with
stakeholders to inform the scope and requirements of a timely, quality service. In addition, PHAC is
engaging stakeholders from a range of sectors, including Provinces and Territories, Indigenous partners,
public safety officials, People with Lived Experience, on the scope and service delivery elements,
including working to understand anticipated demand for 9-8-8. Finally, PHAC is learning from
international experience, including the United States, which recently introduced 988 in July 2022.
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service with its partners. Talk Suicide Canada currently provides 24/7 suicide crisis support via the phone
(1-833-456-4566), in English and French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and by text (45645), in
English and French, in the evenings, to people in Canada. 2023, this service will provide people across
Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from trained responders, using the technology of
their choice (voice, text or chat).
The Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focuses on raising public
awareness, reducing stigma, disseminating information and data,and promoting the use of research and
evidence-based practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next
report planned for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the
Government of Canada to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously
supported by parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan
that aligns with the Framework.

BACKGROUND
Young women and girls in Canada are struggling with their mental health. In comparison to male peers,
a number of metrics display a disparity between the sexes.
Self-reported mental health among girls and young women is considerably lower than their male peers.
The proportion of girls and young women reporting excellent or very good mental health in 2020 was
13-19% lower than male peers for the age groups 10-14, 15-19, and 20-24. Less than 50% of young
women 15-24 reported excellent or very good mental health in 2020. COVID-19 has likely exacerbated
the problem. In 2020, a positive screen for generalized anxiety disorder was almost 2 times higher
among women than men in the 18-34 age group (24.5% and 13.0% respectively), over 2 times higher for
posttraumatic stress disorder (11.5% and 4.6%), and almost 1.5 times higher for major depressive
disorder (22.7% and 18.3% respectively).
Emergency room visits for anxiety and depression in 2021-2022 show a similar pattern; the rates of
young women visiting the ER for anxiety or depression are 2 to 4 times higher than their male peers,
depending on the age group and diagnosis. Young women aged 15-19 and 20-24 visit the ERfor anxiety
or depression at the highest rates among all age groups (175 to 177 visits per 100,000 population).
In addition, young women and girls starting from age 10 are more likely to be hospitalized for anxiety or
depression than their male peers. In2021-2022, females aged 10-14 were hospitalized at a rate 6.2
times higher than their male peers for depression in 2021 (37.2 discharges per 100,000 population as
compared to 6.0 discharges per 100,000 population), and 4.7 times higher than their male peers for
anxiety (42.5 discharges per 100,000 population as compared to 8.95 discharges per 100,000
population). This pattern of increased risk of hospitalization due to depression or anxiety holds for
young women 15-19 and 20-24, with rates 2.4 to 3.2 timeshigher than their male peers.
Rates of dispensation of mood and anxiety medication suggest that the pandemic has affected young
women and girls more dramatically than their male peers. While dispensation of these medications has
increased in all age-sexgroupings from 2016-2021, a disproportionate increase was seen for females in
all but the youngest (5-9) age category, as compared to their male peers.
Dispensation of antipsychotics has also disproportionately increased among young women from 2020-
2021.In all age groups with the exception of children (5-9), an increase in the rate of antipsychotic
dispensation was seen from 2020-2021 for young women, while the rate remained stable for young
men.
The population of young women and girls in Canada is alsoone that is largely overrepresented among
those hospitalized for eating disorders. From age 10-19, young women and girls are hospitalized for
eating disorders at a rate 10 times that of their male peers, reaching 21.2 hospitalizations per 100,000
population for those aged 15-19 in 2021-2022. This rate drops sharply for those aged 20-25 and 25+,
highlighting the need for care among female youth.
Wellness Together Canada
In response to the global public health challenge of COVID-19, in April 2020 the Government of Canada
launched an online mental health and substance use support portal, Wellness Together Canada (WTC).
The portal provides free, credible information and supports available 24/7 to individuals across Canada
in both official languages to help address their mild to moderate mental health and substance use
issues.
WTC offers a variety of resources to support the mental health of young women and girls. A few
examples of relevant resources include general information and healthy coping mechanisms for the
most common mental health concerns that affect women, such as depression, anxiety, stress and eating
disorders.
WTC offers information and support on sexual and family abuse, and information on self-harm and
suicide.
WTC offers peer to peer support communities and counseling services for young women and girls who
want to exchange with other individuals or with a counsellor.
WTC users have access to more in-depth materials when they create an account, including a 2-week
session course on choosing a major or occupation, a 5-week program on anxiety and stress, and a 65-
minute course on handling disappointments.
Federal Investments to Provinces and Territories and Integrated Youth Services
The Government of Canada is also committed to supporting the mental health of young women and
girls, as evidenced through investing $5 billion over ten years (from 2017 to 2027) to support provinces
and territories (PTs) to improve access to mental health and addiction services in their jurisdictions. This
investment is in accordance with the Common Statement of Principles for Shared Health Priorities
(CSoP), which was jointly agreed to by federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) Ministers of Health (with
the exception of Quebec) in August 2017. In the CSoP, Ministers of Health agreed to prioritize expanded
access to community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth as one of three
priorities for the federal funding.
Eleven out of thirteen provinces/territories have identified youth focused initiatives, which could include
integrated youth services, as part of their bilateral agreement action plans. Three provinces have
specifically identified integrated youth services (IYS) as part of their action plans.
IYSmodels of care provide locally relevant, effective, youth-focused and integrated services for mental
health/substance use within the community. IYS locations are easily accessible community-based “one
stop shops” that provide an integrated suite of services, which can include peer support, mental health
and primary care support and employment counselling, as well as support for navigating these systems
of care. Each site leverages existing services and reflects the needs of the local community, so the suite
of available services varies by location. There are currently 50 operational integrated youth hubs across
Canada and 60 under development.
All 13 provinces and territories have developed or are developing an Integrated Youth Services (IYS)
network in their regions. Additionally, there is an Indigenous IYS network in progress. These hubs are
easily accessible community-based “one stop shops” that provide an integrated suite of services, which
can include peer support, mental health and primary care support and employment counselling, as well
as support for navigating these systems of care.
There are approximately 50 operational integrated youth hubs across Canada and 60 under
development. Three of the most developed networks are in British Columbia (Foundry), Ontario (Youth
Wellness Hubs Ontario), and Quebec (Aire Ouverte), with British Columbia and Ontario specifically
identifying the use of bilateral funding to support these networks. This demonstrates how the federal
government can work constructivelywith provinces and territories to spread and scale evidence-based
practices in the mental health and substance use space.
The development of an Indigenous IYS network was driven by the participation of Indigenous
communities across Canada. These First Nations and Inuit communities led efforts to shift youth mental
health towards culturally competent care through the Access Open Minds Indigenous Council. Several
Indigenous communities are currently participating in an emerging Indigenous IYS network.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use Services
Budget 2021 provided $45 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, the Public
Health Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to help develop national
mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations,
and key stakeholders.
On March 14, 2022, Health Canada announced a partnership with Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to
develop national standards formental health and substance use services, to help fulfil commitments
made in Budget 2021. Standards will be evidence-based and developed through consensus-based
processes that engage experts, health organizations, people with lived and living experience,and other
key stakeholders. Standards are tools for supporting health providers in the delivery of high-quality and
equitable mental health and substance use services, and will help to ensure a consistent level of care is
provided. They will also help to formalize what Canadians can expect in terms of the quality of services,
while providing an evidence-based framework for service delivery in priority areas.
SCC is coordinating the development of an integrated suite of national standards for mental healthand
substance use services in priority areas that align with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities (CSOP), which includes Integrated Youth Services. The Government has emphasized the
importance of engagement with diverse stakeholders and promotion of health equity principles, which
have been incorporated into the development process.
2021 Mandate Commitments
The Government of Canada is committed to working with provinces, territories and other partners to
promote access to high-quality mental health and substance use services for Canadians with a range of
needs.
In support of this aim, the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has been mandated with:
• Ensuring mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of theuniversal health care
system;
• Understanding and addressing health inequities, including for Indigenous people, Black
Canadians and vulnerable Canadians;
• Leading a whole-of-society approach to address problematic substance use in Canada; and
• Workingin collaboration with provinces/territories
To realize these objectives, the Minister will deliver on a comprehensive set of new and ongoing
commitments, including establishing a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help
expand the deliveryof high quality, accessible mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
Budget 2022 reaffirmed the intention of engaging provinces and territories on the development of a
CMHT, which would provide a permanent and ongoing source of funding for mental health services.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The Government will provide:
• $100 million over three years to support projects that promote mental health and prevent
mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including health
care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and Black and other
racialized Canadians.
• $50 million to support projects to address posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in
frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Children & Youth
Under the Health Care Policy and Strategies Program (HCPSP) at Health Canada, the federal government
is providing funding to the following projects:
• $2M from 2021-2024 to the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) to develop and pilot a
national specialized peer support certification program for use by post-secondary institutions to support
student mental health.
• $6.8M from 2019-2024 to Foundry to help organizations implement integrated models of youth
mental health care. This complements $9M in funding to Frayme from 2019-2024 to promote broader
implementation of integrated youth services in Canada.
• $2M from 2021-2026 to the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) to increase the
spread of the Aaniish Naa Gegii: theChildren’s Health and Well‐being Measure (ACHWM), co-developed
with Indigenous partners to help measure the health and wellbeing of Indigenous children.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding will support the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.
Teen Dating Violence
PHAC funds programming to prevent teen and youth dating violence, including community and school-
based initiatives that teach skills for healthy and safe relationships based on respect and consent. In
addition, PHAC funds initiatives to support the health of survivors of family violence, including trauma-
informed physical and mental health promotion for youth.
Suicide Prevention
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recently announced that it
will adopt 9-8-8 for Canadians to call or text when in need of immediate mental health crisis and suicide
prevention support. This will be launched across Canada on November 30, 2023.
In parallel, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is preparing for implementation of a three-digit
number for suicide prevention from a service delivery perspective. On August 31, 2022, PHAC
announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) was selected to lead coordination
of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experience delivering Talk Suicide Canada. As a first step, CAMH
will develop collaborations with key organizations to start building capacity, and engage with
stakeholders to inform the scope and requirements of a timely, quality service. In addition, PHAC is
engaging stakeholders from a range of sectors, including Provinces and Territories, Indigenous partners,
public safety officials, People with Lived Experience, on the scope and service delivery elements,
including working to understand anticipated demand for 9-8-8. Finally, PHAC is learning from
international experience, including the United States, which recently introduced 988 in July 2022.
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
servicewith its partners. Talk Suicide Canada currently provides 24/7 suicide crisis support via the phone
(1-833-456-4566), in English and French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and by text (45645), in
English and French, in the evenings, to people in Canada.
The Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focuses on raising public
awareness, reducing stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and
evidence-based practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next
report planned for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the
Government of Canada to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously
supported byparliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan
that aligns with the Framework.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence to Underpin Initiatives
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)invested over $413
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research.
CIHR, in partnership with the Graham Boeckh Foundation, is supporting ACCESS Open Minds, a national
project that is transforming the way youth aged 11-25 access mental healthcare by developing and
testing evidence-informed approaches into IYS. There are currently 17 sites operating in 7 provinces and
one territory. These sites have transformed youth mental health services in diverse ways based on local
context. For example, in Ulukhaktok, a remote community in the Northwest Territories where
professional service providers are not always available, the site is evaluating a model where lay health
workers are trained to provide support to youth in distress.
The IYS Network of Networks Initiative ($1M over 1 year), was also launched by CIHR in April 2022 to
create a Canada-wide network of provincial and territorial learning health systems for Integrated Youth
Services for mental health and substance use.
In addition, CIHR committed$6.25M over 5 years to the Mental Health in the Early Years funding
opportunity in March 2022, with a focus on mental health initiatives for young children (ages 0-5),
Indigenous Peoples, as well as transforming mental health with integrated care.
CIHR isalso leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative supported 101 research projects, of $13.5 million from CIHR and
partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel composed of leading Canadian experts in
mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated through these projects will be mobilized to
ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
Statistics Canada developed and administers a web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. In addition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cycles of
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (with a third cycle in development) to better
understand the wider impacts of the pandemic on mental health in Canada. A special collection of
research articles based on the first cycle of data was released in the HealthPromotion and Chronic
Disease Prevention Journal on September 27, 2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also
resumed in September 2020. The Canadian Community Health Survey provides data on a variety of
mental health indicators, and has been collected for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for
ongoing measurement of changes in mental health of the Canadian population as the pandemic
continues and as Canada recovers.
Additionally, the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth, with a second cycle planned for
2023, explores issues that have an impact on the physical and mental health of children and youth (aged
1-17 years). As well, the 2022 Mental Health and Access to Care Survey, focuses on the mental health
status of Canadians aged 15+ years and their access to and need for services and supports. This survey
also intends to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health as well as evaluate
changes in patterns of mental health, service use and functioning in the last ten years.
Mental Illness Surveillance
As part of its mandate, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is pursuing ongoing surveillance of
mental illness in the Canadian community, including in young women and girls. It uses multiple data
sources toprovide the most up to date evidence available, including the Canadian Chronic Disease
Surveillance System (CCDSS), the Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY) and the
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).
The CCDSS is a collaborative network of provincial and territorial chronic disease surveillance systems,
supported by PHAC. It identifies chronic disease cases of all residents who are eligible for provincial or
territorial health insurance, and contains aggregated data that can be stratified by age, gender and
geographical locations. In 2010, the CCDSS was expanded to track and report on health services use for
mental illness overall, as well as for mood and anxiety disorders in the Canadian population.
The 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY) is a national, cross-sectional survey
that provides health-related information on Canadian children and youth. The survey is representative
of the Canadian population aged 1 to 17 years as of January 31, 2019, living in private dwellings in
Canada's ten provinces and three territories.
As well, to help address data gaps around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families,
and communities in terms of their mental health (including symptoms of anxiety and depression, and of
post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), PHAC partnered with Statistics Canada in the development of the
Survey on COVID-19 and mental health. The survey contains information on the proportion of Canadians
who screened positive for these conditions by age group and gender, and look at the more at-risk
groups. These surveys were conducted at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide
timely information on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Canadians.

BACKGROUND
On April 14, 2016, BC first declared apublic health emergency due to the rise in opioid-related deaths.
Since then, two other PTs have also declared emergencies: Alberta declared a public health crisis in May
2017 and the Yukon declared a substance use health emergency in January 2022.
Mostrecent national data indicates that 30,843 apparent opioid toxicity deaths occurred between
January 2016 and March 2022. Toxicity of supply continues to be a major driver of the crisis with as
many as 85% of accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths in 2022 thus far (January to March) involving
fentanyl. While Canadians of all walks of life are affected, there are striking patterns, with death most
common among males and individuals aged 20 to 59 years old.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compounding the ongoing overdose crisis, and people who use drugs are
experiencing higher risks related to an increasingly toxic illegal drug supply and reduced access to
treatment and harm reduction services. Several jurisdictions have observed unprecedented numbers
and rates in relation to the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although these increases have been observed across the country, Western Canada continues to be
highly impacted. In 2021, the British Columbia Coroners Service reported 2,267 illegal drug toxicity
deaths, a 28% increase from 2020 and a 130% increase over the number of deaths in 2019. There have
been 1,468 deaths in the first eight months of 2022 in BC, a decrease of 1 over the same time period in
2021 (1,469 deaths)
Data released by Alberta in September 2022 indicated that in 2021 the province reported 1,823 deaths
from all substances, the highest number per year since the province began tracking such deaths in 2016.
Of these deaths, 1,616 were related to opioids. The highest opioid-related death count was in Edmonton
(621) followed by Calgary (501).
A dynamic and complex set of factors influence who is most at risk, including but not limited to: gender,
age, being part of a racialized or Indigenous community, and having a history of criminalization,
discrimination or trauma. So far in 2022 (January to March), males accounted for the majority (76%) of
accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths. Among both males and for females, the majority of
accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths were among individuals aged 20 to 59 years.
Among youth 0-19, between January 2016 and March 2022, the total number of opioid and stimulant-
related poisoning hospitalizations among girls was consistently higher compared to their male
counterparts. Between 2018 and2021, girls aged 0-19 years experienced fewer accidental apparent
opioid toxicity deaths compared to boys of the same age; however, preliminary data from 2022 (January
to March) shows higher numbers of deaths among girls over boys in that age category (11 and 7 deaths,
respectively).
Data points to people commonly dying of overdoses alone and mostly indoors. In Ontario, from March
to December of 2020, 73% of fatal overdoses occurred where no one was present to intervene. In BC, in
2021, 84% of fatal overdoses occurred indoors, more specifically, 56% occurred in private residences.
Tragically, overdose deaths among First Nations people have also surged. First Nations people in BC died
of an overdose at 5.4 times the rate of other BC residents in 2021. InAlberta, First Nations people died
of an accidental opioid overdose at seven times the rate of other residents between January and June of
2020. In Saskatchewan, almost three times as many First Nations females died from accidental deaths
involving opioids than Caucasian females did in 2021.
The impact of the crisis is not measured in deaths alone and, in particular, the healthcare system has
also been impacted by marked increases in opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations and calls for
emergency medicalservices (EMS) since the start of the pandemic. Compared to the two-year period
before the pandemic (April 2018–March 2020, 9,470 hospitalizations) there was a 24 percent increase
in opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations during the first two years of the pandemic (April 2020–
March 2022, 11,760 hospitalizations).
COLLECTION OF NATIONAL OPIOID-AND STIMULANT-RELATED DATA
The Public Health Agency of Canada publishes quarterly data on opioid-and stimulant-related harms on
behalf of the Special Advisory Committee (SAC) on the Epidemic of Opioid Overdoses. Data on opioid-
and stimulant-related deaths is provided by Chief Coroners and Chief Medical Examiners. The time
required to complete an investigation into the cause of death for someone suspected of an overdose
can range from approximately three to 24 months.
PHAC also conducts modelling to understand potential trajectories of opioid-related deaths as the crisis
evolves.
FEDERAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS
To reflect the Government of Canada’s comprehensive approach to addressing the overdose crisis,
targeted funding of $815M have been allocated across federal departments and agencies (including
Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Public
Safety Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency, and Statistics Canada) to address key, interrelated
priorities:
• Over $656M allocated or committed to increase access to evidence-based treatment and life-
saving services, such as harm reduction;
• Over $43M allocated for awareness, prevention, and stigma reduction activities;
• Over $74M allocated for data, research,and surveillance initiatives;
• Over $42M allocated for collective law enforcement efforts to enhance safety and security.
To effectively deliver on the federal response to the overdose crisis, federal departments and agencies
require salary and operational costs for staff, and other necessary resources. These are standard costs
associated with delivering policies and programs in the federal government, and are thoroughly
reviewed on an ongoing basis. For example, operational costs have been allocated to support, but are
not limited to:
• Health Canada’s Drug Analysis Service (DAS), in which employees provide scientific and technical
services to help Canadian law enforcement agencies in their activities involving illegal drugs, including
helping police forces safely dismantle illegal drug laboratories;
• Border control agents disrupt the flow of illegal substance into Canada; and
• The Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP) analysts that receive and review applications
to ensure funding is disbursed tocommunities for quality projects in a timely manner.
Of the $656M for increased access to evidence-based treatment and life-saving services, such as harm
reduction, $157M is allocated for operational costs since 2017. Of the $43M for awareness, prevention,
and stigma reduction activities, $18M is allocated for operational costs since 2017.
The Minister of Health established an Expert Task Force on Substance Use in March 2021 that provided
expert advice on Canada’s federal drug policy, including examining potential alternatives to criminal
penalties for personal drug possession. The Task Force provided its final advice on alternatives to
criminal penalties in May 2021, and on federal drug policy in June 2021. Both reports of the Task Force
have been madepublicly available and can be found online at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-
canada/corporate/about-health-canada/public-engagement/external-advisory-bodies/expert-task-
force-substance-use/reports.html.
LITIGATION AGAINST OPIOID MANUFACTURERS CANADA
OnOctober 17, 2022, the Province of British Columbia announced that it would be introducing
amendments to its Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act that would allow the federal
government to join a B.C.-led class-action lawsuit against opioid manufacturers and permit the
expansion of the number of defendants.
Amendments to the B.C. legislation will enable the governments of British Columbia and Canada to
pursue recovery from opioid manufacturers, wholesalers and other potential defendants in a class-
action lawsuit that is in progress. The amendments will strengthen the act by ensuring directors and
officers of corporate defendants may also be held accountable.
In 2018, B.C. commenced a class-action lawsuit against over 40 manufacturers and distributors of
opioids on behalf of provincial and territorial governments in Canada and enacted the Opioid Damages
and Health Care Costs Recovery Act to support the class action. The aim of the class action and
legislation is for governments to recover costs for health care provided to patients that resulted from
wrongful conduct of opioid manufacturers, distributors and their consultants. The class action is
expected to be certified in 2023.
On June 29, 2022, Purdue Pharma Canada agreed to a proposed $150 million settlement with provinces
and territories for the recovery of health care costs related to the sale and marketing of opioids.

of immediate mental health crisis and suicide prevention support effective November 30, 2023.
• The Government of Canada announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health will
lead the coordination of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experiencedelivering Talk Suicide Canada.
• The Government of Canada is committed to ensuring this service has the quality and capacity to
meet the demand, connecting people to effective crisis support when they need it the most.
IF PRESSED ON TIMING FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A THREE-DIGIT NUMBER FOR SUICIDE
PREVENTION CRSIS SUPPORT (84 words)
• The CRTC announced the 9-8-8 number will be launched across Canada on November 30, 2023.
• In preparation, the Public Health Agency of Canada contracted a firm to analyze service volumes
associated with launching a three-digit number, and estimated that service volumes mayincrease four
to six-fold by 2027. This analysis will help identify the resources required to support the service.
• The Agency is also engaging with a range of stakeholders, experts and representatives from
provincial and territorial governments for their perspectives on what a successful roll-out will require.
IF PRESSED ON WHAT SERVICE PROVIDERS NEEDTO IMPLEMENT 9-8-8 (74 words)
• As highlighted in the CRTC’s decision, telecommunication service providers will need to
implement 9-8-8 dialing acrossCanada. This includes:
• Introducing ten-digit local dialing in areas where seven-digit dialing is still the default; and
• Making the necessary changes to their networks to enablecallers to dial or text 9-8-8.
• The objective is to ensure that everyone in Canada will be able to use the 9-8-8 number, and
these important steps will help get us there.
IF PRESSED ON WHY BUDGET 2022 DID NOT ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO SUPPORT A THREE-DIGIT
NUMBER (89 words)
• The CRTC’s decision and ongoing engagement will help to determine resource requirements for
9-8-8.
• While three-digit crisis line support is in development, we will continue to support Talk Suicide
Canada and surge capacity for distress lines and Kids Help Phone to meet demands for services.
• Crisis support is available to people in Canada through:
o Talk Suicide Canada (1-833-456-4566)

o Provincial and local distress lines
o Trans Lifeline (1-877-330-6366)
IF PRESSED ON U.S. EXPERIENCE IMPLEMENTING A THREE-DIGIT NUMBER (87 words)
• In the United States, preparations for a three-digit number tookplace over a four-year period.
• The choice to assign 9-8-8 in Canada and the United States is due to the unavailability of a three-
digit numberending in 11 (e.g., 411, 911).
• We are working closely with our counterparts in the United States, andlearning from their best
practices,to help guide Canada’s approach to implementing a three-digit number.
• Our goal is to be ready for a safe and seamless rollout so that calls do not go unanswered.
IF PRESSED ON THE CONTRACT WITH PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS, WHICH IS ANALYZING ANTICIPATED
SERVICE VOLUMES (119 words)
• The Public Health Agency of Canada contracted PricewaterhouseCoopers to understand
anticipated service volume and demand for 9-8-8.
• This analysis factored in anticipated demand over time, the impact of diverted calls from other
services, including 911 and local crisis lines, as well as new growth associated with introducing an easy-
to-remember number.
• This analysis forecasts a four to six-fold increase by 2027. This will inform planning,including
costs and resources.
• This exercise builds on forecasting analysis undertaken by the U.S. which estimated a four- to
tenfold growth in service volumes within the firstfive years of launching 9-8-8.
• The U.S. experienced a higher volume of calls and texts than initially forecasted.These findings
will inform the service volume forecast for Canada.
IF PRESSED ON WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO BEGIN THE CONSULTATION ON THE 9-8-8 SERVICE MODEL
AND IMPLEMENTATION (136 words)
• In April 2022, the CRTC asked the Public Health Agency of Canada to determine the termination
point of calls made to the abbreviated number, the entity that would manage calls to the abbreviated
number, as well as the scopeof the services being provided.
• The CRTC noted that these determinations would need to be informed through engagement
with partners, including provincial and territorial governments, suicide prevention stakeholders, and
Indigenous organizations. The CRTC asked for receipt of this information in fall 2022. The Public Health
Agency of Canada has confirmed that this engagement is underway and it will provide a response in this
timeframe.
• Engagement with representatives from provinces and territories, Indigenous organizations and
key stakeholders began in May 2022 and is ongoing. It will inform implementation planning so that 9-8-8
is operational on November 30, 2023.
BACKGROUND
In the Minister of Mental Health and Addiction’s Mandate Letter, the Minister was directed to
implement a three-digit suicide prevention number. On December 11, 2020, parliamentarians voted
unanimously in favour of a motion sponsored by MP Todd Doherty (Conservative, British Columbia)
calling on the federal government to act immediately to set up a national 9-8-8 number to consolidate
all existing suicide crisis numbers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recently announced that it
will adopt 9-8-8 for Canadians to call or text when in need of immediate mental health crisis and suicide
prevention support. This will be launched across Canada on November 30, 2023.
In parallel, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is preparing for implementation of a three-digit
number for suicide prevention from a service delivery perspective. On August 31, 2022, PHAC
announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) was selected to lead coordination
of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experience delivering Talk Suicide Canada. As a first step, CAMH
will develop collaborations with key organizations to start building capacity, and engage with
stakeholders to inform the scope and requirements of a timely, quality service. In addition, PHAC is
engaging stakeholders from a range of sectors, including Provinces and Territories, Indigenous partners,
public safety officials, and People with Lived Experience on the scope and service delivery elements,
including working to understand anticipated demand for 9-8-8. Finally, PHAC is learning from
international experience, including the United States, which estimated a fourfold to tenfold increase in
call volumes for their service when it launched on July 16, 2022, after over 4 years of preparation.
This initiative builds upon the Government’s current support of a pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service. PHAC is currently investing $21 million over 5 years ($4.2 million per year) for CAMH, with their
partners, to implement and sustain Talk Suicide Canada. In addition, $800,000 per year is allocated to
PHAC to cover the oversight, administration, reporting and evaluation activities associated with the
Contribution Agreement with CAMH. The Canada Suicide Prevention Service provides people across
Canada with suicide crisis support from trained responders via phone (1-833-456-4566), in English and
French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Calls to the service are answered by trained responders from
a network of 11 community-based distress centres across Canada and a back-up hub of responders.
As highlighted in Budget 2021, the government is committed to ensuring funds are available to support
the creation of this three-digit number.

increased demand for crisis support at this time.
BACKGROUND
Suicide is a significant public health issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds across Canada.
Between 2017 and 2019, there were approximately 4,500 deaths by suicide per year in Canada, which is
equivalent to 12 people dying by suicide every day. In 2019, suicide was the 9th leading cause of death
among all Canadians, and the 2nd leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 34, behind
unintentional injuries. According to preliminary data, there were 3,839 deaths by suicide reported in
2020. The 2020 data is provisional and incomplete, and could potentially increase by 5 to 15% over the
next year. This delay is due to the length of time that coroners and medical examiners sometimes
require to complete their investigations. At this time, caution should be used in drawing any conclusions
regarding suicide trends during the pandemic. There is no single cause that fully explains or predicts
suicide; a combination of factors are associated with suicide, such as mental illness, physical health,
personal issues and loss, childhood abuse and neglect, and exposure to trauma.
Three-Digit Number for Mental Health Crisis and Suicide Prevention: The Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recently announced that it will adopt 9 8 8 for Canadians to call
or text when in need of immediate mental health crisis and suicide prevention support. This will be
launched across Canada on November 30, 2023. In parallel, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)
is preparing for implementation of a three-digit number for suicide prevention from a service delivery
perspective. On August 31, 2022, PHAC announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health
(CAMH) was selected to lead coordination of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experience delivering
Talk Suicide Canada.
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in CAMH to implement and sustain a
fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention service with its partners. Talk Suicide Canada
currently provides 24/7 suicide crisis support via phone (1-833-456-4566) in English and French, 24
hours a day, seven days a week and by text (45645) in English and French in the evenings to people in
Canada. This investment includes $2 million to develop resources for distress centres that are tailored to
meet the needs of diverse populations, including Inuit, First Nations and Métis communities.
When a person reaches out to Talk Suicide Canada, their call or text is routed to the closest available
distress centre that is a member of the network. If a responder is not available in that centre, the call is
automatically routed to the next available responder, with the back-up hub responding to interactions
when responders in a member distress centre are not available. This approach allows for support from a
local centre where responders have a better understanding of resources available locally. All calls to Talk
Suicide Canada are answered by a trained suicide prevention responder.
In 2021-22, almost 89,000 interactions took place, representing approximately 65% of incoming calls,
and 76% of incoming texts (i.e. over this period, approximately 35% of incoming calls and 24% of
incoming texts were unanswered). The service continues to struggle to meet demand. Incoming
interactions continue a steady increase: there were 12,081 incoming interactions in June 2022,
compared to 10,378 for June 2021. The voice answer rate for the service has declined over the past
year. This is a challenge for all crisis services through the pandemic. PHAC is working with crisis services
to help address these issues. Thereis potential for this volume to increase further as announcements in
Canada and the USA create awareness of the existing service and prompt additional people to reach out.
COVID-19 Mental Health Crisis Supports: Through the 2020 Fall Economic Statement,the Government of
Canada announced a $50 million investment to bolster the capacity of distress centres. PHAC
administered an initial round of funding grants to 57 distress centres in 2021-22, and is currently
distributing grants to 14 other distress centres in 2022-23 (following a second solicitation reaching
organizations not included in the first round of funding). In addition, $2 million of this funding is
supporting CAMH as it curates resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of priority
populations.
Motion 174–A National Suicide Prevention Action Plan: In April 2018, MP Charlie Angus (NDP, Timmins-
James Bay) sponsored motion M-174, calling for the Government to establish a National Suicide
Prevention Action Plan. On May 8, 2019, parliamentarians voted unanimously in favour of M-174,
though it is non-binding. The proposed actions in the plan are aligned with the Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention. Activities in progress across the Government of Canada include the development of
resources and tools to reduce stigma and raise public awareness about suicide and its prevention,
research and knowledge translation (i.e. the synthesis, dissemination, and exchange of evidence-based
information to improve the health of Canadians), and theimplementation of a Pan-Canadian suicide
service prevention service (Talk Suicide) and 3-digit number (988). An update on M-174 was included in
the December 2020 Progress Report on the Framework. Efforts to develop the Action Plan will be
included in theDecember 2022 Progress Report as part of legislated reporting on the Framework. PHAC
is starting to facilitate coordination and collaboration on elements of the Action Plan with relevant
federal departments, provinces and territories, agencies and key stakeholders, including those from First
Nations, Inuit and Metis organizations, through its convening role on this Action Plan.
Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health and Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events: PHAC is
currently conducting surveillanceto understand the impact of COVID-19 on suicide and mental health.
The Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health showed that 2.4% of adults in Canada reported suicidal
ideation since the pandemic began in 2020, which is not significantly different from the 2.7%before the
pandemic in 2019; however, the percentage increased significantly in spring 2021 to 4.2%. Risk factors
of reporting suicide ideation during the pandemic included being under 65, Canadian-born, a frontline
worker, reporting pandemic-related income/job loss or loneliness/isolation, experiencing a highly
stressful/traumatic event during one's lifetime, and having lower household income and educational
attainment. Continued surveillance of suicide and risk/protective factors is needed to inform suicide
prevention efforts.
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING (MAID)–ELIGIBILITY FOR PERSONS WITH A MENTAL DISORDER AS THE
SOLE UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION IN MARCH 2023 (102 words)
• The Government acknowledges concerns regarding the end in March 2023of the temporary
exclusion from access to MAID for persons with a mental disorder as their sole underlying medical
condition.
• The mandatory eligibility criteria and safeguards in the legislation set a very high bar for access
to MAID. We laud the rigorand diligence demonstrated by MAID practitioners who abide by all the
requirements of the legislation.
• We are working hard with provinces, territories, clinicians and regulatory bodies on MAID
practice standards and accredited training programs, whichwill ensure MAID assessors are well
equipped to make decisions on complex requests for MAID.
IF PRESSED ON OTHER INITIATIVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS UNDERTAKING (104 words)
• Our Government is working with provinces, territories and partners onimplementation of key
recommendations of the Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness.
• We have convened a task group to develop MAID practice standards that will provide clinicians
with guidance when assessing complex MAID requests, including those involving mental disorders.
• We are also funding the Canadian Association of MAID Assessors and Providers to develop a
fully accredited MAID training curriculum. Modules will be rolled out early in 2023.
• Over the longer term, we will implement a research agenda that aims to provide greater insight
into the circumstances and experiences of people who seek MAID.
IF PRESSED THE QUESTION OF MAID FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS AS THE SOLE UNDERLYING
CONDITION OR THEEXPERT PANEL REPORT (118 words)
• Our Government is working to support MAID practitioners who, after March 17, may receive
MAID requests from persons with a mental disorder as their sole underlying medical condition.
• Some MAID practitioners have already assessed cases that involve mentaldisorders, alongside
other conditions. We are working on further guidance to help providers interpret the eligibility criteria
and apply the safeguards to these complex cases.
• We have convened a task group to develop MAID practice standards that will be available in
early 2023, providing clinicians across the country with consistent guidance when assessing complex
MAID requests, including involving mental disorders. We are encouraging provincial and territorial
governments and medical regulators to work collaboratively to consider and adopt these practice
standards.
IF PRESSED ON CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE WILL SEEK MAID AS A FORM OF SUICIDE, ESPECIALLY THOSE
WITH A MENTAL DISORDER (128 words)
• The latest review of international studies suggests that the availability of MAID does not have a
statistically significant impact onsuicide rates.
• The MAID framework sets a high bar for access. Just as persons with physical ailments must be
suffering grievously and be in an advanced state of irreversible decline arising from an incurable
condition in order to receive MAID, only individuals with severe and long-standing mental illnesses that
have been resistant to multiple treatments and interventions willever be considered for MAID.
• The Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness also noted that suicide assessments are already
part of MAID practice. This includes ensuring that a person’s request is consistent, unambiguous and
rationally considered during a prolonged period of stability, and not during a time of crisis.
IF PRESSED ON THE GOVERNMENT’S REACTION TO MEDIA STORIES ALLEGING THAT PEOPLE ARE
SEEKING MAID DUE TO LACK OF NEEDED SERVICES (84 words)
• We do not comment on individual cases, as only the individuals and their clinicians involved
truly know the full circumstances.
• While a person may say they want to receive MAID due to inadequate services, the eligibility
criteria and safeguards in the law are robust. Two independent practitioners must conclude a person is
eligible and an offer of available servicesand supports must be made and considered by the requester.
• No person would ever be approved for MAID simply because they lack adequate support
services.
IF PRESSED ON EFFICACY OF NEW SAFEGUARDS FOR WHERE DEATH IS NOT REASONABLY FORSEEABLE
(ALSO KNOWN AS TRACK 2 CASES) (103 words)
• Recognizing the variability in the types of applicants who might make a request, the legislation
established new and enhanced safeguards that require among other things, inclusion of professional
expertise in the assessment process, and offering of alternateoptions to alleviate suffering.
• These safeguards ensure that practitioners consider the physical, psychological and social
circumstances of requesters who are not nearing a foreseeable natural death.
• We are also supporting development of MAID practice standards to help clinicians consistently
interpret and apply eligibility criteria and safeguards when assessing complex requests that may fall
under the track two stream, including requests where a mental disorder is involved.
IF PRESSED ON UPCOMING REGULATORY AMENDMENTS TO EXPAND DATACOLLECTION FOR MAID (63
words)
• The amendments to the Regulations for the Monitoring of MAID will respond to the changes to
the MAID legislation in 2021, and will provide for the collection of new data related to race, gender and
Indigenous identity, as well as disability status of MAID requesters.
• These amendments are on track to be published in Canada Gazette, Part II prior to January 1,
2023.
IF PRESSED ON INDIGENOUSENGAGEMENT ON MAID (39 words)
• Health Canada is committed to engaging with Indigenous peoples on the culturally safe
implementation of MAID, guided by principles respecting the Government of Canada’s relationship with
Indigenous peoples, and based on recognition and respect for the right to self-determination.
IF PRESSED ON THE POTENTIAL ELIGIBILITY OF MATURE MINORS FOR MAID (130 words)
• Many Canadians have strong views about MAID. There may be additional tensions and
sensitivities when considering potentialeligibility for mature minors.
• Generally speaking, mature minors are those under 18 with the capacity to make informed
health care decisions and the ability to actvoluntarily on those decisions.
• In many provinces and territories, mature minors already have the right to make important
decisions regarding their care. This includes the right to consent to or refuselifesaving medical
treatment.
• Medically assisted dying is still relatively new in Canada and we are still learning. That is why the
Government will be working closely with experts and other stakeholders to support necessary research
on its implementation. We also look forward to reviewing the Special Joint Committee’s final report on
MAID, expected in October 2022.
BACKGROUND
BILL C-7, AN ACT TO AMEND THE CRIMINAL CODE (MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING)
On September 11, 2019, the Superior Court of Québec ruled in favour of two plaintiffs (Jean Truchon
and Nicole Gladu) who had challenged the Criminal Code eligibility requirement that anindividual’s
natural death be reasonably foreseeable and the more stringent provincial requirement for a person to
be at the end of life. The governments of Canada and Québec did not appeal the decision.
On February 24, 2020, the federal government tabledproposed amendments to the 2016 Criminal Code
provisions on MAID (Bill C-7) in response to Truchon. The Bill was terminated with the prorogation of
Parliament but was re-introduced on October 5, 2020 (its content was unchanged). It received Royal
Assent on March 17, 2021.
The new 2021 MAID legislation:
• removes the requirement for a person’s natural death to be reasonably foreseeable in order to
be eligible for MAID
• introduces a two-track approach to procedural safeguards based on whether or not a person’s
natural death is reasonably foreseeable
o existing safeguards are maintained and, in some cases, eased for eligible persons whose natural
death is reasonably foreseeable
o new and strengthened safeguards are introduced for eligible persons whose natural death is not
reasonably foreseeable
• temporarily excludes eligibility for individuals suffering solely from mental illness for 24 months,
and requires the Ministers of Justice and Health to initiate an expert review tasked with making
recommendations within the next year on protocols, guidance and safeguards for MAID for persons
suffering from mental illness
• allows eligible persons whose natural death is reasonably foreseeable, and who have a set date
to receive MAID, to waive final consent if they are at risk of losing capacity in the interim
• requires expanded data collection and analysis through the federal monitoring regime to
provide a more complete and inclusive picture of MAID in Canada
IMPLEMENTING KEY RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE EXPERT PANEL ON MAID AND MENTAL ILLNESS
The revised legislation includes a 24-month sunset clause on the exclusion of MAID requests from
individuals where mental illness is the sole underlying condition. After March17, 2023, individuals with
a mental illness as their sole condition will be able to request and receive MAID, providing they meet all
other eligibility criteria.
During this exclusion period, an Expert Panel was appointed by Ministers of Justice and Health to
conduct an independent review to consider protocols, guidance and safeguards to apply to MAID
requests by persons who have a mental illness. The final report of the Expert Panel on MAID and Mental
Illness was tabled in Parliament on May 13, 2022. Itincludes 19 recommendations that provide guidance
on the interpretation of the MAID eligibility criteria, application of the legislated safeguards, and the
assessment process, as well as advice on measures to improve the functioning of Canada’s MAID regime
more broadly.
A key conclusion of the Panel was that the existing MAID eligibility criteria and safeguards (interpreted
appropriately) buttressed by existing laws, standards, and practices in related areas of healthcare, can
provide an adequate structure for assessing those more complex (track two) MAID requests, including
where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition.
On July 26, 2022, the Ministers of Health, Justice and Disability Inclusion issued a news release on the
Government’sprogress in implementing several of the Panel’s key recommendations that will help
prepare the MAID practice community in assessing these complex MAID requests. This progress
included: developing a practice standard for MAID; developing a nationally fully accredited MAID
curriculum; enhancements to the data collection system under the Regulations for the Monitoring of
MAID; plans for Indigenous engagement; and, federally-funded qualitative research on MAID.
PARLIAMENTARY REVIEW OF MAID LEGISLATION
The newlegislation also required that a Parliamentary Review be initiated within 30 days following Royal
Assent. The Parliamentary Review must address (but not necessarily be limited to) the topics of mature
minors, advance requests, mental illness, the state ofpalliative care in Canada, and the protection of
Canadians with disabilities.
The Special Joint Committee on MAID (AMAD) held three meetings before dissolution. The committee
reconvened in April 2022 and, on June 23, 2022, submitted an interim report, specifically focused on
MAID where a mental disorder is the sole underlying medical condition. The committee’s final report is
due no later than February 17, 2023.
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO MAID REGULATIONS
On May 21, 2022, the proposed amendments to the existing 2018 Regulations for the Monitoring of
Medical Assistance in Dying were published on the Canada Gazette, Part 1 website for a 30-day public
comment period. The proposed regulatory amendments support Canada’s MAID regime by allowing for
enhancements to data collection and reporting through the federal MAID monitoring regime to provide
a more comprehensive and inclusive picture of how MAID, with expanded eligibility, is being
implemented in Canada.
Once the amended Regulations are enacted, the expanded data collection requirements will commence
and the information collected will be reflected in the federal annual report on MAID in Canada for 2023,
to be publicly released in the summer of 2024.
INDIGENOUS ENGAGEMENT
Throughout various consultative andParliamentary discussions on MAID, Indigenous participants, as
well as several Parliamentarians, spoke to about the lack of and need for meaningful engagement with
Indigenous peoples on the topic of MAID to understand their diverse views and perspectives.This view
was most recently echoed by the May 2022 final report by the Expert Panel on MAID and Mental Illness,
and the June 2022 Interim Report of the Special Joint Committee on MAID. These calls for engagement
come from the concerns raised around the potential impacts of MAID on Indigenous peoples, such as:
• Undermining of suicide prevention efforts;
• Straining already inaccessible culturally-safe health care services, including palliative care; and
• Exacerbating systemic racism experienced by Indigenous peoples in the health care system.
FUNDING FOR MAID INITIATIVES
Expanded access to MAID (as codified in the new legislation) increases the complexity of eligibility
assessments and requires the administration of the enhanced safeguards aimed at protecting vulnerable
people who might be induced to seek an assisted death. Budget 2021 provided $13.2 million to Health
Canada over five years, beginning in 2021-22, with $2.6 million per year ongoing, to support the
development of training and guidance materials for practitioners, as well as a policy driven research
agenda. This investment will contribute to an enhanced knowledge base to support safe, sensitive and
consistent implementation of the MAID legislation and safeguards across the country.
MAIDAND MATURE MINORS
Generally, mature minors are those under 18 with the capacity to make informed health care decisions
and the ability to act voluntarily on those decisions. While provinces and territories may have different
requirements, in some cases mature minors are already legally capable of making end-of-life decisions
(such as withdrawing life-sustaining treatment), but this is dependent on the capacity of the young
person to understand their decision and their ability to provide consent.
Individuals under the age of 18 are not currently eligible for MAID. In 2016, the federal Ministers of
Health and Justice tasked the Council of Canadian Academies (CCA) with completing a review of
questions related to complex MAID requests, including MAID and mature minors. The CCA report,
tabled by the Ministers in December 2018 indicated:
o The need for key safeguards for mature minors, noting that autonomy develops in a relational
context, where decision making should involve the patient, their family (parentsor guardians), and an
inter-professional healthcare team;
o While chronological age can provide some developmental generalizations about decision-
making abilities, it is not the most important variable in determining capacity for informed consent;
o Capacity of a minor to consent to a healthcare intervention must be determined on a case-by-
case basis by considering their experiences, maturity, circumstances, and the gravity of the decision at
hand; and,
o Any deliberation on whether to permit MAID for currently excluded groups would benefit from
greater engagement with Canadian society, especially those groups most likely to be affected. They also
noted that the voice of youth is missing in the discussions surrounding access to MAID for mature
minors.
There is limited research in the area of assisted dying for mature minors. Understanding the views of
minors, family members and health care professionals about MAID requests for mature minors will
inform future policy development. To this end, Health Canada is in the early stages of launching research
that will generate nationally informed evidence for policymakers to consider in deliberations pertaining
to requests for MAID from mature minors.
The mandate of the Special Joint Committee on MAID includesthe question of MAID and mature
minors. The final report of this Committee is due by February 17, 2023.
MALTREATMENT IN AMATEUR SPORT (74 words)
• Sports organizations can play an important role in helping young women and girls build
confidence, self-esteem, and a positive body image.
• Disturbingly, stories of maltreatment in gymnastics remind us that cases of violence, abuse, and
neglect in sport can have serious negative impacts on women and girls’ physical and mental health.
• Coaches and leaders in sport all have a part to play in preventing violence and abuse, and in
supporting the wellbeing of participants.
IF PRESSED ON HEALTH PORTFOLIO ROLE TO ADDRESS MALTREATMENT IN SPORTS (55 words)
• Coaches are well-placed to play an important role as mentors and role models for safe and
healthy relationships.
• This is why the Health Portfolio has invested $935,000 between 2019 and 2024 to support the
Coaching Association of Canada to develop, implement, and evaluate a program to assist coaches in
recognizing, preventing, and addressing gender-based violence.
BACKGROUND
Maltreatment in sport is an under-researched area, but Canadian studies suggest that alarmingly high
rates of athletes have experienced some form of neglect or physical, psychological or sexual abuse in a
sports setting. Female athletes experience higher rates of maltreatment than males.
Some health impacts associated with maltreatment in sport include the development of anxietyand
depression disorders, problematic substance use, eating disorders, chronic pain and suicidal thoughts.
On October 31, 2022, the Standing Committee on the Status of Women passed a resolution to
undertake a study on sport and the status of women, including the physical and emotional health and
safety of women and girls in sport.
Gymnastics Canada
In recent years, there have been multiple accusations of abuse against individual Gymnastics Canada
coaches and officials.
During the winter of 2022, concerns about the culture of Gymnastics Canada and allegations of
maltreatment from members of the organizations were reported in the media. On July 22, 2022, the
Minister of Sport announced that she would suspend any funding to Gymnastics Canada until they
become a signatory to Abuse-Free sport, offered by the Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner. On
October 19, 2022, Gymnastics Canada became a signatory via the Office of the Sport Integrity
Commissioner and has now met all of the current conditions.
Policy Measures to Prevent Maltreatment in Sport, led by Canadian Heritage/Sport Canada
In June 2018, measures were announced requiring federally funded sport organizations to take all
necessary measures to create a workplace free from harassment, abuse ordiscrimination of any kind, as
well as to disclose and provide for third party investigations of incidents and to provide mandatory
training to their members by April 1, 2020.
Budget 2019 provided $30 million over five years to Canadian Heritage, starting in 2019–20, with $6
million per year ongoing, to enable Canadian sports organizations to promote accessible, ethical,
equitable and safe sports.
Sport Canada supported the Coaching Association of Canada to host a series of nationwide consultations
on the development of a Universal Code of Conduct to address harassment and abuse in Canadian sport
(the Code). The resulting Code, which includes general principles, definitions of misconduct and
prohibited behaviours, as well as an approach to sanctions,was endorsed by the majority of national-
level sport organizations and released publicly in December 2019. The Office of the Sport Integrity
Commissioner administers the implementation of the Code and delivers services to federally funded
organizations.
Policy coordination has also been advanced with provinces and territories. In February 2019, during the
meeting of federal, provincial and territorial Ministers responsible for sport, physical activity and
recreation, Ministers endorsed the Red Deer Declaration for the Prevention of Harassment, Abuse and
Discrimination in Sport. As part of this declaration, Ministers will develop a collaborative approach to
increase awareness, prevention, identifying and reporting, and monitoring to address harassment,
abuse, and discrimination in sport.
Health Portfolio Efforts to Prevent and Address Maltreatment in Sport
Through “Preventing Gender-Based Violence: the Heath Perspective,” PHAC is supporting the Coaching
Association of Canada to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention to assist coaches in
recognizing, preventing and addressing gender-based violence and promoting healthy relationships in
and through sports. Online educational resources and a toolkit for coaches will support approximately
6,000 coaches across Canada to address issues such as bystander empowerment, men and boys as allies
in the prevention of violence, and locker room gender-based violence. The resources and tools will also
be shared with Canada's 82 National Sport and Multisport Service Organizations to complement efforts
to address abuse, harassment and discrimination in sport. PHAC is contributing $935,576 over 5 years to
support this project.
PHAC is also providing the Coaching Association of Canada with $2.8 million in funding to support the “I
can help!” project, which will increase mental health literacy among coaches and community sports
leaders who work with remote, Indigenous, and economically disadvantaged communities, newcomers
to Canada, persons with disabilities, and Canadian Armed Forces families. This mental health education
will empower coaches to say “I can help” to improve the mental health of athletes and participants. This
project is expected to reach 2.5 million coaches across Canada. This was part of a Budget 2021
investment of $100 million over three years to promote mental health and prevent mental illness in
populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.Note: this project has not yet been

BACKGROUND
KEY FACTS
• In 2021, 17.8% of the population of Canadalives in rural areas. In the year prior (2020), only
88.3% of individuals living in rural areas had access to internet at home, compared to95.3% of those
living in urban areas.
- In 2022, the Government of Canada announced $2.75 billion for the Universal Broadband Fund,
which aims to better support high-speed Internet projects in rural, remote, and Indigenous communities
and help address access disparities.
• Individuals living in rural areas reported higher positive self-rated mental health (63.1%)
compared to their urban counterparts (58.3%), though reported rates of mood and/or anxiety disorders,
perceived need for mental health care, and unmet needs were similar across these populations.
• In very remote areas, suicide and self-inflicted injuries were the second major cause of
preventable deaths, and the rate was more than three times higher in very remote areas than in easily
accessible areas.
• Access to mental health services in Canada is not equitably dispersed. In 2017, there were only 3
psychiatrists per 100,000 population in rural areas, compared to 17 in urban areas. In rural areas, there
were 37 nurses practicing in mental health and addiction per 100,000 population, compared to 76 in
urban areas.
• More recently, (2021-22), rural survey respondents were less likely to report accessing mental
health support (17% of rural compared to 23% of urban respondents).
- Rural individuals were most likely to receive mental health care from a family doctor (43.9%),
whereas urban individuals were more likely to go online for mental health support (35.3%). As well,
20.2% of rural individuals reported receiving online support, compared to 24.1% of urban individuals.
- Reasons for not accessing mental health care amongst rural respondents included preference
for self-management (41%), service affordability (29%), barriers in access to care (24.2%), and lack of
trust in the health system and social services (17.5%).
Primary care is the backbone of high-performing health care systems. It serves a dual function in the
health care system as the direct provision of first-contact services and a coordination function to ensure
continuity across health care settings. However, Canadians, including children, continue to struggle to
access primary care. In 2021, 14.5% ofCanadians 12 years and over lacked a regular health care
provider. These disparities are felt more acutely by rural Canadians, with the distribution of family
physicians to rural communities decreasing over time (13.1% in 2016; 12.8% in 2020), while it increases
slightly in urban environments (86.7% in 2016; 86.9% in 2020).
Mental health issues can impact any population and children and youth are no exception. In fact, two
thirds or more of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25. It is estimated that mental
health issues affect over 800,000 Canadian children and youth annually. The COVID-19 pandemic has
had significant impacts of this population. For example, the percentage of Canadians aged 12-17 who
reported their mental health as “very good” or “excellent” decreased from 74.1% in 2018, to 61.2% in
September 2021/February 2022. Moreover, rural populations are in a particularly vulnerable position
due to the lack of availability and accessibility of mental health services and supports, and primary care
within their communities.
Health is a shared responsibility in Canada, with the federal government and the provinces and
territories having distinct roles. While primary responsibility for delivery of health care services to
Canadians falls within provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government sets and administers
national standards for publicly insured health services through the Canada Health Act, and provides
funding support for provincial and territorial health care services through the Canada Health Transfer.
Therefore, the department continues to work closely with FPT partners to advance primary care and
mental health priorities, with a particular focus on rural communities.
Health Canada has been collaborating with provinces, territories and other partners to identify ways in
which the primary care system could be strengthened to:
• Ensure every Canadian has timely access to a family doctor or family health team, and
• Leverage virtual care to support access to and delivery of high-quality health care, including
within the context of primary care.
2021 Mandate Commitments
The Government of Canada is committed to working with provinces, territories and other partners to
promote access to high-quality mental health and substance use services for Canadians with a range of
needs.
In support of this aim, the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has been mandated with:
• Ensuring mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of the universal health care
system;
• Understanding and addressing health inequities, including for Indigenous people, Black
Canadians and vulnerable Canadians;
• Leading a whole-of-society approach to address problematic substance use in Canada; and
• Working in collaboration with provinces/territories
• With the support of the Minister of Rural Economic Development, explore pathways to increase
the accessibility of mental health services in rural areas.
To realize these objectives, the Minister will deliver on a comprehensive set of new and ongoing
commitments, including establishing a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help
expand the delivery of high quality, accessible mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
Budget 2022 reaffirmed theintention of engaging provinces and territories on the development of a
CMHT, which would provide a permanent and ongoing source of funding for mental health services.
Pressure on Existing Provincial/Territorial Mental Health Services
With Canadians physical distancing and isolated, there is an unprecedented need for virtual services,
such as telehealth and other information lines (e.g., 811), and provinces/territories are not able to
absorb the increased demand.
It is critical that Canadians have access to effective tools to self-monitor, promote their mental well-
being, obtain credible and reliable information, and access services when deemed necessary. Canadians
need to be re-assured that there are supports available to help alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.
Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services and Address the
Impacts Of COVID-19 On Canadians’ Mental Health
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of more than $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As part of this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reductionand evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
On May 3, 2020, the Prime Minister announced $240.5M to support virtual care and digital tools for
Canadians. $150M of this funding is being provided to provinces and territories through bilateral
agreements to enhance virtual services. Health Canada has also been collaborating with provinces,
territories and other partners to identify ways in which virtual care can be leveraged to support access
to and delivery of high-quality care, including within the context of primary care.
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada invested $130 million from 2020-22 in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal, and received $140 million in Budget 2022 to support the portal
fortwo more years beginning in 2022-23. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist with finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national service offering support to young people via
phone, text and live chat, and is a global leader in developing and delivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
As of November 7, 2022, almost 3 million individuals have accessed the WTC portal and the PocketWell
app has been downloaded a total of 30,974 times.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use Services
Budget 2021 provided $45 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, the Public
Health Agency of Canada, and theCanadian Institutes of Health Research to help develop national
mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations,
and key stakeholders.
On March 14, 2022, Health Canada announced a partnership with Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to
develop national standards for mental health and substance use services, to help fulfil commitments
made in Budget 2021. Standards will be evidence-based and developed through consensus-based
processes that engage experts,health organizations, people with lived and living experience, and other
key stakeholders. Standards are tools for supporting health providers in the delivery of high-quality and
equitable mental health and substance use services, and will help to ensure a consistent level of care is
provided. They will also help to formalize what Canadians can expect in terms of the quality of services,
while providing an evidence-based framework for service delivery in priority areas.
SCC is coordinating the development of an integrated suite of national standards for mental health and
substance use services in priority areas that align with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities (CSOP), including Digital Mental Health and Substance Use Apps. The Government has
emphasized the importance of engagement with diverse stakeholders and promotion of health equity
principles, which have been incorporated into the development process.
Support for the Mental Health Needs ofThose Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years to support projects that promote mental health and prevent
mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including health
care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and Métis, and Black and other
racialized Canadians.
• $50 million to support projects to address posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in
frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Suicide Prevention
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) recently announced that it
will adopt 9-8-8 for Canadians to call or text when in need of immediate mental health crisis and suicide
prevention support. This will be launched across Canada on November 30, 2023.
In parallel, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is preparing for implementation of a three-digit
number for suicide prevention from a service delivery perspective. On August 31, 2022, PHAC
announced that the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) was selected to lead coordination
of 9-8-8 service delivery, building on its experience delivering Talk Suicide Canada. As a first step, CAMH
will develop collaborations with key organizations to start building capacity, and engage with
stakeholders to inform the scope and requirements of a timely, quality service. In addition, PHAC is
engaging stakeholders from a range of sectors, including Provinces and Territories, Indigenous partners,
public safety officials, People with Lived Experience, on the scope and service delivery elements,
including working to understand anticipated demand for 9-8-8. Finally, PHAC is learning from
international experience, including the United States, which recently introduced 988 in July 2022.
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH)to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service with its partners. Talk Suicide Canada currently provides 24/7 suicide crisis support via the phone
(1-833-456-4566), in English and French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and by text (45645), in
English and French, in the evenings, to people in Canada. 2023, this service will provide people across
Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from trained responders, using the technology of
their choice (voice, text or chat).
The Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focuses on raising public
awareness, reducing stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and
evidence-based practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next
report planned for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the
Government of Canada to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously
supported by parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan
that aligns with the Framework.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million toKids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
$9 million is being provided to the United Way (through New Horizons) for practical services for seniors.
The Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of BlackCanadians Fund is investing $10 million to support
community-based projects across Canada.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding will support the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.

BACKGROUND
Mental illness health issues can impact any population and children and youth are no exception. In fact,
almost two thirds of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25. It is estimated that mental
health issues affect over 800,000 Canadian children and youth annually.
Youth disproportionately visit the Emergency Department (ED) seeking mental health/substance use
services. For example, between 2008-2009 and 2018-19 there was a 61% increase in visits made by
youth to the ED for such services.During this time, hospitalizations for mental health disorders also
increased by 60%.
This cohort is also affected by suicide. In 2020, suicide was the second leading cause of death among
individuals aged 15 to 34. In 2020, among individuals aged 15 to 24 years, males accounted for 68% of
suicide deaths; and among individuals aged 25 to 34 years, males account for 75% of suicide deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the mental health of children and youth.
Concerns about the virus itself have been compounded by impacts on school and routines, social
activities, isolation, and decreased access to services and supports.
Results from 2022 showed that youth were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health as
comparedto older Canadians. Most Canadians were less likely to report excellent or very good mental
health during the COVID-19 period, and the difference between 2019 and 2022 was particularly evident
for younger adults. Only 50.9% of those aged 18 to 34 reportedexcellent or very good mental health in
2021-2022 during the pandemic, compared to 60.8% before the pandemic in 2019. In children aged 12-
17 years, 61.2% reported that their mental health was very good or excellent in 2021-2022, compared to
73.0% in 2019.
More recent survey results from early 2021 showed that younger Canadians persistently indicate the
highest anxiety and depression of all age groups. For example, almost 30% of 16 to 17 year olds
reported high levels of anxiety and depression, and one in three reported suicidal ideation in the past
year. Conversely, this group reported a lower incidence of diagnosis of a mental health issue, suggesting
they do not have access to diagnostic services and care.
Additionally, in a Statistics Canada survey of perceptions of personal safety, 11% of Youth aged 15 to 24
reported that harassment or attacks on the basis of race, ethnicity, or skin colour have increased in their
neighbourhood since the start of the pandemic.
Government Actions and Investments to Support the Mental Health Needs of Children and Youth
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments and Integrated Youth Services
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services (2017-2027). The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via
negotiated bilateral agreements, informed by the 2017 Common Statement of Principles on Shared
Health Priorities agreed to by FPT Ministers of Health. In it, Ministers ofHealth agreed to prioritize
expanded access to community-based mental health and addiction services for children and youth as
one of three priorities for the federal funding.
All 13 provinces and territories have developed or are developing an IntegratedYouth Services (IYS)
network in their regions. Additionally, there is an Indigenous IYS network in progress. These hubs are
easily accessible community-based “one stop shops” that provide an integrated suite of services, which
can include peer support, mental health and primary care support and employment counselling, as well
as support for navigating these systems of care.
There are approximately 50 operational integrated youth hubs across Canada and 60 under
development. Three of the most developed networks are in British Columbia (Foundry), Ontario (Youth
Wellness Hubs Ontario), and Quebec (Aire Ouverte), with British Columbia and Ontario specifically
identifying the use of bilateral funding to support these networks. This demonstrates how the federal
government can work constructively with provinces and territories to spread and scale evidence-based
practices in the mental health and substance use space.
The development of an Indigenous IYS network was driven by the participation of Indigenous
communities across Canada. These First Nations and Inuit communities led efforts to shift youth mental
health towards culturally competent care through the Access Open Minds Indigenous Council. Several
Indigenous communities are currently participating in an emerging Indigenous IYS network.
2021 Mandate Commitments
The Government of Canada is committed to working with provinces, territories and other partners to

There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide immediate access to
support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that can assist with
finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial and territorial
services, and does not replace them. In January 2022, Wellness Together Canada launched PocketWell,
which is a companion app to the online Portal.
Through the Portal and the app, children and youth (ages 5 to 29) are able to access mental health and
substance use resources, including Kids Help Phone, which provides online, phone and text based
support to young people who are in crisis or dealing with mental health issues.
Additional resources are being invested in Kids Help Phone ($14.8M over 36 months from April 2020 to
March 2023) provide mental health support to youth in need during the pandemic.
As of October 31, over 2.89 million individuals across all provinces and territories have accessed the
Wellness Together Canada portal in over 8.16 million web sessions. The new PocketWell mobile app has
been downloaded a total of 30,792 times. Additionally, over 46% of registered clients of the portal are
under 30, an age group that tends to underutilize traditional mental health services.
As of August 15, over 2.64 million individuals across all provinces and territories have accessed the
Wellness Together Canada portal in over 7.55 million web sessions. The new PocketWell mobile app has
been downloaded a total of 28,075 times. Additionally, over 45% of registered clients of the portal are
under 30, an age group that tends to underutilize traditional mental health services.
Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 announced $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those most
affected by the pandemic, including youth. Funded projects are expected to begin in Spring 2022 and to
reach diverse populations across Canada. Projects will support mental health promotion and mental
illness prevention interventions, in addition to initiatives that build the capacity of service providers to
deliver programming in safe, effective and trauma-informed ways.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence to Underpin Initiatives
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $413
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research.
CIHR, in partnership with the Graham BoeckhFoundation, is supporting ACCESS Open Minds, a national
project that is transforming the way youth aged 11-25 access mental health care by developing and
testing evidence-informed approaches. There are currently 17 sites operating in 7 provinces and one
territory. These sites have transformed youth mental health services in diverse ways based on local
context. For example, in Ulukhaktok, a remote community in the Northwest Territories where
professional service providers are not always available, the siteis evaluating a model where lay health
workers are trained to provide support to youth in distress.
The IYS Network of Networks Initiative ($1M over 1 year), was also launched by CIHR in April 2022 to
create a Canada-wide network of provincial and territorial learning health systems for Integrated Youth
Services.
In addition, CIHR committed $6.25M over 5 years to the Mental Health in the Early Years funding
opportunity in March 2022, with a focus on mental health initiatives for young children (ages 0-5),
Indigenous Peoples, as well as transforming mental health with integrated care.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative supported 101 research projects, of $13.5 million from CIHR and
partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel composed of leading Canadian experts in
mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated through these projects will be mobilized to
ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
Statistics Canada developed and administers a web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. Inaddition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cycles of
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (with a third cycle in development) to better
understand the wider impacts of the pandemic on mental health in Canada. A specialcollection of
research articles based on the first cycle of data was released in the Health Promotion and Chronic
Disease Prevention Journal on September 27, 2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also
resumed in September 2020. The Canadian CommunityHealth Survey provides data on a variety of
mental health indicators, and has been collected for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for
ongoing measurement of changes in mental health of the Canadian population as the pandemic
continues and asCanada recovers.
Additionally, the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth, with a second cycle planned for
2023, explores issues that have an impact on the physical and mental health of children and youth (aged
1-17 years). As well, the 2022 Mental Health and Access to Care Survey, focuses on the mental health
status of Canadians aged 15+ years and their access to and need for services and supports. This survey
also intends to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health as well as evaluate
changes in patterns of mental health, service use and functioning in the last ten years.
Mental Illness Surveillance
As part of its mandate, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is pursuing ongoing surveillance of
mental illness in the Canadian community. It uses multiple data sources to provide the most up to date
evidence available, including the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS), the Canadian
Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY) and the Canadian CommunityHealth Survey (CCHS).
The CCDSS is a collaborative network of provincial and territorial chronic disease surveillance systems,
supported by PHAC. It identifies chronic disease cases of all residents who are eligible for provincial or
territorial health insurance, and contains aggregated data that can be stratified by age, gender and
geographical locations. In 2010, the CCDSS was expanded to track and report on health services use for
mental illness overall, as well as for mood and anxiety disorders in the Canadian population.
The 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY) is a national, cross-sectional survey
that provides health-related information on Canadian children and youth. The survey is representative
of the Canadian population aged 1 to 17 years as of January 31, 2019, living in private dwellings in
Canada's ten provinces and three territories.
As well, to help address data gaps around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals, families,
and communities in terms of theirmental health (including symptoms of anxiety and depression, and of
post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), PHAC partnered with Statistics Canada in the development of the
Survey on COVID-19 and mental health. The survey contains information on the proportion of Canadians
who screened positive for these conditions by age group and gender, and look at the more at-risk
groups. These surveys were conducted at various times during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide
timely information on the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Canadians.

SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS (83 words)
• Gender is emerging as a powerful predictor of mental health outcomes. Gender-transformative
approaches are improving the way we design, implement and scaleup novel health interventions.
• Recognizing these important factors, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (or CIHR) is
taking an active role in shaping important policies and programs that will improve the quality of
federally-funded health research.
• Gender-based Analysis Plus will ensure that CIHR-funded research, including mental health
research, will lead to better health outcomes to all Canadians, including women and girls.
IF PRESSED ON ADDITIONAL EFFORTS AND SUPPORTS (133 words)
• Since 2017, CIHR has implemented a Gender-based Analysis Plus in Research Action Plan to
better integrate this analysis in CIHR’s research funding programs, which includes training for peer
reviewers and a requirement to include this analysis in applications for funding.
• Additionally, we have made investments of over $496 million in mental health and behavioural
disorders research, and $180 million in research on addictions by CIHR over the last five years.
• For example, CIHR’s COVID-19 and Mental Health initiative funded six projects that directly
addressed women’s mental health and substance useneeds in the COVID-19 context.
• Last month, our Government also launched the National Women’s Health Research Initiative,
which will advance a coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-priority
areas of women’s health and ensure new evidence improves women’s care and health outcomes.
BACKGROUND
In recent years, the need to enhance the sensitivity of the health system to women's health issues has
gained increasing recognition. Also evident has been the need for more research, particularly on the
links between women's health and their social and economic circumstances. Equally apparent has been
the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadians’ mental health. Studies have
demonstrated that half of all Canadians have reportedthat their mental health has worsened during the
pandemic.
As Canada’s federal health funding agency, CIHR is committed to funding research that will help provide
a better understanding of the gender bias in mental health research and address knowledge gaps where
they exist.
The gender dynamic of mental health research has been covered by a number of important projects
over the past few years that highlight the different experiences of women and girls. Several of these
projects touch specifically on thelived experiences of indigenous women and girls, such as Healing the
Whole Self: Developing a Holistic Group Psychotherapy for First Nations Women with Experiences of
Intimate Partner Violence.
The CIHR Institute of Neurosciences, Mental Health andAddiction (CIHR-INMHA) includes a diversity
lens in its understanding of brain health, and prioritizes initiatives that bring more balance to current
inequalities in health research and knowledge. This includes but is not limited to fostering the
integration of sex and gender perspectives into its strategic activities.
In late 2018, CIHR-INMHA brought together a multidisciplinary group of 14 experts in Post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and related conditions for a scientific roundtable on Post-traumatic stress (PTS)
research in Canada. The goal of this meeting was to share knowledge and stimulate dialogue, and to
ultimately inform CIHR’s PTS research initiative by defining key communities in Canada that are most
affected by PTS, and identifying specificresearch priorities. Following the roundtable and through
additional meetings, seven groups were identified as those significantly impacted by PTS, including
women, children and youth survivors of abuse.
CIHR is also supporting the Health Research Training Platform (HRTP) Pilot. This program is intended to
support the development of interdisciplinary, interjurisdictional and intersectoral training environments
that will equip trainees with the skills required for non-academic careers. Through the initialpilot
program funded earlier this year, CIHR is supporting on HRTP in the area of Stigma Reduction and Life
Course Mental Wellness for LGBTQIA2 Populations. In collaboration with the CIHR Institutes of Aging,
Gender and Health, Indigenous People’s Health and external partners including the Public Health Agency
of Canada and Egale Canada, this HRTP intends to focus on LGBTQIA2 life course stress and resilience,
including stigma, stress, violence, depression, suicide, alcohol, drugs, addiction, eating disorders, family
and social environments, and healthcare support.
The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting mental health of women and girls, and surveys suggest
women have higher levels of anxiety and loneliness than men as a result of the pandemic. The COVID-19
and Mental Health Initiative through CIHR has funded six projects addressing women’s mental health
and substance use needs in the COVID-19 context.
As part of the initiative, CIHR supported a project led by Dr. Abi Sriharan (at the University of Toronto)
which was on “Stress, Burnout and Depression In Women in Health Care during COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Preliminary findings from this work showed that female health care workers are at increased risk for
stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic.
On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Youth
officially launched the National Women’s Health Research Initiative (NWHRI), which is supported by an
investment of $20 million over five years provided in Budget 2021. The NWHRI will advance a
coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-priority areas of women’s
health and will ensure new evidence improves women’s and gender-diverse people’s care and health
outcomes. It will also promote an intersectional lens to research and care to tackle persistent gaps for all
women, including for Indigenous, Black, and racialized women, women with disabilities, and members of
Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (2SLGBTQIA) communities.
CIHR is also signatory to the Health Portfolio SGBA+ Policy and in 2016-17 CIHR developed the SGBA+ in
Research Action Plan to better integrate SGBA+ in CIHR’s research funding programs. Key elements of
the Action plan include 1) Promoting SGBA+ to the CIHR research community; 2) Enhancing capacity of
the CIHR research community to apply SGBA+; 3) Embedding SGBA+ into research programs and
initiatives; and 4) Demonstrating the impact of integrating SGBA+ in health research.
EATING DISORDERS (85 WORDS)
• Our Government cares deeply about the mental heath of Canadians, including those living with
eating disorders.
• This is why, through Budget 2017, we are providing provinces and territories with $5 billion over
10 years to improve access to mental health and addiction services, including services for thoseliving
with eating disorders.
• In addition, through the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR), we have invested $5.6
million in researchover the last 5 years to improve health outcomes for individuals with eating disorders
living in Canada.
BACKGROUND
Dissatisfaction with one’s weight or shape and unhealthy relationships with food and physical activity
can contribute todisordered eating (e.g., unhealthy eating behaviours, like binge eating, restrictive
eating, meal skipping to lose weight) and eating disorders (i.e., disorders which involve a clinical
diagnosis; reflects more severe or chronic disordered eating). Eatingdisorders, such as anorexia nervosa,
are serious mental illnesses with significant morbidity and mortality. Disordered eating and eating
disorders affect individuals of all body sizes.
A number of factors can contribute to the development of an eating disorder, including biology (genetic
and biochemical), psychology (personality and mental health), and social factors (such as cultural norms
about food and appearance). Individuals experiencing other emotional or psychological disorders such
as substance usedisorder, depression, or a personality disorder, are at a higher risk of developing an
eating disorder.
The experience of living with an eating disorder affects each individual differently. Some individuals may
feel shame stemming from their symptoms orthe way they eat, and can be secretive about food and
eating. Some individuals experience other mental illnesses concomitantly, such as anxiety, depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, together with their eating disorder.
Due to stigmatization, people living with eating disorders may go to greatlengths to hide their disorder.
While eating disorders are serious and can have life-threatening complications, they are also treatable
illnesses.
Incidence and/or Prevalence inCanada
Although eating disorders can affect anyone, they typically begin in adolescence or young adulthood and
affect women ten times more than men. Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey show that
the prevalence of eating disorders among Canadians aged 15 years and over was 0.4% in 2002 and 0.5%
in 2012. More recent data from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth found that
0.32% of youths aged 5 to 17 years had a diagnosed eating disorder (0.45% in females; 0.19% in males).
Recent findings from a Knowledge Synthesis undertaken by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research
(CIHR) show that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted individuals living with eating
disorders. Through the pandemic, those with eating disorders have experienced heightened
psychological distress, increases in eating disorder symptoms and behaviours, reduced motivation for
recovery, and greater risk of eating disorder relapse. With the closure of eating disorder day hospitals,
the most severely ill patients have had more limited access to the intensive treatment they require.
Caregivers face difficulties with first-time home monitoring for children living with eating disorders, and
clinicians have been challenged with providing the same level of care virtually.
Recent data from both before and during the pandemic show that the rate of hospitalizations for eating
disorders was 1.6 times higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for females aged 10 to 17. Potential
explanations for this increase include disruptions to daily routines, fewer physical activities, poor social
supports and increased exposure to media and social media.
Eating Disorder Research and Surveillance
The Government of Canada, through CIHR, has invested $5.6 million in the past five years (2017-18 to
2021-22) in research to improve health outcomes for individuals living in Canada with eating disorders.
This investment supports the work of researchers at universities and research institutes across Canada
as they build the evidence base on theseconditions and develop effective interventions. For example,
through the Transitions in Care initiative, CIHR is supporting a project led by Dr. Gina Dimitropoulos at
the University of Calgary that will seek to co-design and implement practice guidelines for transitions in
care from pediatric to adult services for youth with eating disorders.
The Government of Canada also recognizes the importance of surveillance for the prevention and
treatment for mental illness and is exploring options for the surveillance of eating disorders. PHAC is
working with Statistics Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information and researchers to
investigate the impacts of the pandemic on a variety of interrelated topics, including healthy eating and
eating disorders.
PHAC is also working with paediatricians across the country on a surveillance study of new diagnoses of
anorexia nervosa during the pandemic through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP).
The CPSP is a joint project of PHAC and the CanadianPaediatric Society that conducts national
surveillance and research into rare and emerging childhood diseases/conditions with disproportionate
risk of disability, morbidity and economic costs to society, despite their low frequency.
Health Portfolio Activities
While the Health Portfolio does not do any direct work in the area of eating disorders, the Government
of Canada provides funding to the provinces and territories for the administration and delivery of health
care services, including mental health services, such as those serving individuals experiencing eating
disorders. Through Budget 2017, the Government provided provinces and territories with $5 billion over
10 years to improve access to mental health and addiction services.
In Ontario, for example, federal funds were used to implement a new province-wide Eating Disorders
Early Intervention Program that will use targeted prevention, mental health promotion, early
identification and early intervention services to address body image, disordered eating and early-stage
eating disorders in children, youth, and young adults.
Federal Initiatives in Response to COVID-19
The Wellness Together Canada portal provides 24/7 access to free and confidential evidence-based
mental health and substance use tools and resources. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals

Health Portfolio as we considers approaches to make progress in this important policy area.
BACKGROUND
KEY FACTS
• According to a 2018 Government of Canada survey, almost one quarter (23%) of mothers
reported feelings consistent with either post-partum depression or an anxiety disorder. These reports
varied across provinces, ranging from 16% in Saskatchewan to 31% in Nova Scotia. Studies show that as
few as 9% of pregnant individuals with perinatal mental health concerns receive treatment.
• Covid-19 has exacerbated the problem; as the rates of perinatal mental health issues and the
need for services has increased, the availability of services has decreased due to shutdowns. Some
studies have reported a3x increase in perinatal mental health problems since the start of the pandemic.
The perinatal period includes both pregnancy and the postpartum period. Perinatal mental health is a
state of well-being in which a pregnant or postpartum person realizes their own abilities, can cope with
the normal stresses of life and work productively, care for themselves and their newborn, and is able to
make a contribution to their community and society.
Perinatal mental illness refers to mental health conditions experienced “around” pregnancy. This
includes pre-existing mental health conditions, but can also refer to new or different mental health
concerns arising around this period.
Maternal stress, anxiety and depression are significant public health issues, increasing the risk of poor
mental and physical health outcomes for mothers along with potential impacts for children and families.
If untreated, consequences include prolonged maternal depression, paternal depression, partner
relationship dissatisfaction and conflict, impaired parent-infant interactions and attachment, risk for
impaired cognitive or psychosocial development for the child (and increased risk of later child
psychopathology) and, in extreme situations, maternal suicide or infanticide. Maternal deaths with a
mental health component, by suicide or drug toxicity, are increasingly recognized as making up a
significant proportion of all maternal deaths.
Current national data collection surrounding mental health does not allow identification of individuals in
the perinatal period. However, it is possible to identify currently pregnant females.
Among pregnant females overall, self-rated mental health was higher than the self-rated mental health
of non-pregnant females (2019-2021). This holds for all agegroups with the exception of teen
pregnancies (15-19), where the self-rated mental health among those who were pregnant was slightly
lower than for those who were not. Pregnant teens were also significantly more likely to report anxiety
than their non-pregnant peers.
Pregnant females 20 to 44 were significantly less likely to report anxiety or depression than their non-
pregnant peers. In contrast, pregnant women 45-54 were significantly more likely to report anxiety or
depression than their non-pregnantpeers.
The literature suggests that additional research is needed to determine the long-term mental health
experiences of teenage parents, particularly studies controlling for confounding effects of demographic,
socioeconomic, environmental, and health related variables. One Canadian study identified that among
Indigenous mothers, social and health factors were more important for predicting long-term mental
health outcomes than experiencing teen pregnancy.
In recent years, some stakeholders have called for greater federal action in the area of perinatal mental
health. On May 13, 2020, a petition was brought forward to create a national perinatal mental health
strategy that would provide direction, policy, and funding to develop specialized, comprehensive
perinatal mental health care services. This includes universal screening and timely access to treatment
for all people during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
On May 5, 2021 (World Maternal Mental Health Day), various MP’s offices sent a request to the former
Minister of Health’s Office on behalf of their constituents regarding a National Perinatal Mental Health
Strategy. It was brought forward by MP Heather McPherson (Edmonton-Strathcona).
On June 3, 2021, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway) put forward Bill C-306, which calls for a National
Perinatal Mental Health Strategy that includes mental health screening and treatment services during
the full perinatal period. This Bill died on the order paper when Parliament was dissolved in August
2021.
On March 31, 2022, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway) put forward Bill C-265, which again called for
a National Perinatal Mental Health Strategy Act that includes measures to provide perinatal mental
health screening and services and reduce barriers to care, aswell as measures to increase perinatal
mental health awareness, training and research.
2021 Mandate Commitments
The Government of Canada is committed to working with provinces, territories and other partners to
promote access to high-quality mental health and substance use services for Canadians with a range of
needs.
In support of this aim, the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has been mandated with:
• Ensuring mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of the universal health care
system;
• Understanding and addressing health inequities, including for Indigenous people, Black
Canadians and vulnerable Canadians;
• Leading a whole-of-society approach to address problematic substance use in Canada; and
• Working in collaboration with provinces/territories
To realize these objectives, the Minister will deliver on a comprehensive set of new and ongoing
commitments, including establishing a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help
expand the delivery of high quality and accessible mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
Budget 2022 reaffirmed the intention of engaging provinces and territories on the development of a
CMHT, which would provide a permanent and ongoing source of funding for mental health services.
Wellness Together Canada
In response to the global public health challenge of COVID-19, in April 2020 the Government of Canada
launched an online mental health and substance use support portal, Wellness Together Canada (WTC).
Theportal provides free, credible information and supports available 24/7 to individuals across Canada
in both official languages to help address their mild to moderate mental health and substance use
issues.
WTC offers a variety of resources to support the mental health of pregnant and postpartum individuals.
A few examples of relevant resources include general information and healthy coping mechanisms for
common mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorders.
WTC offers information and support on sexual and family abuse and information on self-harm and
suicide.
WTC offers peer to peer support communities and counseling services for pregnant and postpartum
individuals who want to exchange with other individuals or with a counsellor.
WTC users have access to more in-depth materials when they create an account, including a 2-week
session course on choosing a major or occupation, a 5-week program on anxiety and stress, and a 65-
minute course on handling disappointments.
Perinatal Surveillance
The Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System monitors and
reports on maternal, fetal and infant health determinants and outcomes while conducting targeted
epidemiological research to address emerging issues. This program has focused largely on indicators of
physical health, some of which can be associated with maternal mental health (e.g., fetal/infant
mortality, maternal chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy). However, formal
indicators concerning risk and protective factors for maternal mental health have yet to be established,
as there are presently no routine national sources of data on maternal mental health or maternal access
to/use of mental health services.
Budget 2022 will bring significant investments towards developing the evidence around the perinatal
period, including perinatal mental health. PHAC will be investing approximately $4.5 million over three
years to support the development and collection of a perinatal experiences survey, with a focus on
mental health during the perinatal period as well as other key issues such as breastfeeding, substance
use, etc. This survey will address a critical data gap, particularly around parental mental health and
parental accessto mental health services.
Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care’s guideline on screening for depression during
pregnancy and the postpartum period
The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Healthcare (Task Force) is an independent arms-length body of
up to 15 clinicians and methodologists established and funded by PHAC. In 2022, the Task Force
published “Recommendation on instrument-based screening for depression during pregnancy and the
postpartum period” in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
The Task Force’s guideline on screening for depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period is
based on the best available scientific evidence. The guideline considered the benefits and harms of
screening for Canadian individuals who are pregnant andup to one year postpartum. The Task Force
recommends against screening using a questionnaire with a cut-off score and advises clinicians to
inquire about the mental health and well-being of pregnant and postpartum patients as part of usual
care during visits.
PHAC Policy and Program Activities
The Health Portfolio undertakes a number of activities to promote maternal and child health, which
includes supporting positive maternal mental health during the perinatal periods. PHAC makes
significant investments to support perinatal mental health through programs aimed at improving
community-level access to supports for prenatal and recently postpartum people, new parents and
young children facing barriers to health equity. In particular, the Canada PrenatalNutrition Program
provides $26.5 million annually to improve the health of at-risk pregnant individuals, with a focus on
mental health, nutrition, and the promotion of positive health behaviours during pregnancy. Through
approximately 240 funded projects,the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program serves more than 45,000
participants across Canada each year.
PHAC also supports the development of several resources promoting the positive mental health of
pregnant/postpartum individuals. These resources provide guidance and advice for both healthcare
professionals and individuals that may face poor mental health during the perinatal period, including
Family-Centred Maternity and Newborn Care National Guidelines; the Mothers’ Mental Health Toolkit;
and ‘Your Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy’.
To provide rapid support for new parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada and PHAC have
recently developed resources to support the mental health of those who are pregnant or have recently
had a baby.

regulation, and social skills to reach their full potential. Each individual with FASD is unique and has
areas ofboth strengths and challenges.
• FASD is the leading known cause of preventable developmental disability in Canada. If someone
is pregnant or planning to become pregnant, the safest choice is to drink no alcohol at all.
BACKGROUND
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a diagnostic term used to describe the impact on the brain
and body of individuals prenatally exposed to alcohol. It is a lifelong disability and people with FASD will
experience some degree of challenges with their motor skills, physical health, learning, memory,
attention, emotional regulation, and social skills. The number of people with the disorder is unknown.
Recent studies from Canada, the US and Europe estimate that 1% to 5% of the population have the
disorder.
A 2013 cost-of-illness study examined the impact of FASD on the material welfare of Canadian society by
analyzing the direct costs of resources spent on health care, law enforcement, children and youth in
care, special education, supportive housing, and long-term care. The results from this analysis
demonstrated that the economic cost associated with FASD in Canada was approximately $1.8 billion
annually in direct costs alone.
Further, Indigenous partners have signalled the importance of preventingFASD through two
recommendations in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action (#33 and #34).
These recommendations focus on FASD, calling for culturally appropriate preventive programs and
criminal justice system reform.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is the federal lead for addressing FASD in Canada through
the FASD Initiative, which includes the FASD National Strategic Projects Fund (NSPF). The Fund allocates
$1.5 million annually for projects that promote education and awareness; harm reduction approaches;
and research into the social determinants of health that impact alcohol consumption and FASD.
Six contribution agreements were funded through the NSPF in 2021-22. These projects supported
prevention and reduction of stigma, and reached an audience of non-pregnant women of childbearing
age, pregnant women and their partners, young adults, individuals with FASD, service providers and
policy makers. Project activities included the development of guidelines for practitioners to use for
screening and talking to women about alcohol use in pregnancy, modifying a school-based FASD
curriculum to be taught in Canada, promotion of FASD prevention in Inuit communities, and virtual FASD
training sessions for justice professionals, among others.
PHAC also leads surveillance activities with respect to maternal and child health issues, including
prenatal alcohol exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders such as FASD. Through the Centre for
Surveillance and Applied Research (CSAR), PHAC is piloting system models for FASD prevalence
estimation, with a view to identifying proper surveillance approaches for FASD. This includes
determining the quality and feasibility of using existing national data sources and piloting other
promising methods to monitor trends in FASD incidence and prevalence over time. As part of prevalence
estimation activities, PHAC published a short scientific paper titled FASD prevalence among children and
youth: results from the 2019 Canadian Health Survey onChildren and Youth in the Health Promotion
and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada journal.
The Government of Canada also promotes healthy pregnancies, including FASD awareness and
prevention, through other supportive policy and programs by (1): supporting evidence-based policy and
guidance for health practitioners and the general public on prenatal issues; and (2) investing in
community-based programs to promote the health of pregnant people, young children and families
facing barriers to health equity, through the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP) and the
Community Action Program for Children (CAPC). Many CAPC and CPNP funded projects offer trusted,
stigma-free and culturally inclusive education resources, in-person and virtual programming and
referrals to other health services related to alcohol and substance use during pregnancy and
breastfeeding. They also provide support to children with FASD and their parents.
PHAC’s FASD Initiative (which includes the National Strategic Projects Fund) is currently undergoing a
planned evaluation through the Office of Audit and Evaluation. The results of the evaluation will inform
the development of a new FASD Five-Year Strategic Plan, and will guide future investments.
Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) currently invests $17.9 million annually to support FASD prevention
activities in First Nations and Inuit communities through regionally based solutions. This includes a
funding increase as part of the Budget 2017 announcement of an additional $83.2 million over five years
to expand Indigenous maternal and child health services with $3.7 million ongoing for FASD starting in
2022-23.
Health Canada leads the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy (CDSS) that aims to protect the health
and safety of all Canadians by minimizing harms from substance use for individuals, families and
communities, including harms caused by alcohol consumption (e.g., FASD). Health Canada also provides
grants and contribution funding through the Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP) to respond
to drug and substance use issues, including efforts related to FASD.
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invests over $6.5 million in projects that are currently
investigating social epigenetics, the use of magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI), brain development and
mental health, proteins that may be developmentally protective, pediatric neuroimaging,
neurobiomarkers, and nutritional preventive intervention in the context of FASD.
The Kids Brain Health Network (KBHN) is receiving $50.8 million from 2009-2024 to improve the
outcomes for children and families impacted by neurodevelopmental disabilities, including FASD as a
national Network Centre of Excellence under the Networks of Centres of Excellence Program (NCE). The
NCE isa Canadian government initiative, which funds partnerships between universities, industry,
government and not-for-profit organizations to create large-scale research networks. As a research
network, KBHN engages with community groups, non-profit organizations, industry, parents, clinicians,
health professionals, provincial and federal governments to advance knowledge to improve outcomes
for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, including FASD, and their families.
ONLINE SAFETY–IMPACTS ON YOUTH (65 words)
• Our Government is committed to putting in place a more equitable regulatory framework to
govern online platforms in Canada. They must do their part to fight harmful content online.
• Our goal is to promote a safer and more inclusive online environment so all Canadians can
express themselves without being subject to hateful or threatening attacks.
• Our Government is seized with the particular challenges facing youth.
Background
Social mediaplatforms such as TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, are increasingly central to
participation in democratic, cultural, and public life. According to Canadian data from the Canadian
Media Technology Monitor (MTM), 81 percent of francophones and 84 percent of anglophones used
any Social Network in the spring of 2020. This has become especially significant among adolescents,
teens, and young adults. A recent Cambridge University Press study indicates that 80 percent of young
people use social media ona daily basis, with almost 50 percent using it for over two hours per day.
Social media platforms can also be used to threaten, intimidate, bully, and harass people–or used to
promote racist, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, misogynist, and homophobic viewsthat target communities,
put people’s safety at risk, and undermine Canada’s social cohesion or democracy. Social media
platforms are also used by predators and offenders to exploit children.
The December 2021 mandate letter to the Minister of CanadianHeritage mandated him to work to
introduce legislation as soon as possible to combat serious forms of harmful online content, while
reflecting feedback received during the previous mandate.
From July 29, 2021, to September 25, 2021, the Government held a public consultation on its proposed
approach to address harmful content online. There were 422 unique responses submitted from
Canadians, industry stakeholders, academia, and civil society. Overall, submissions were predominantly
critical of both the process of the consultation and the design and substance of the framework itself. In
February 2022, Canadian Heritage published a What We Heard report, summarizing the feedback
received during the consultation.
To help adapt the 2021 legislative proposal, the Minister convened an Expert Advisory Group, composed
of 12 experts from diverse backgrounds and experiences, which met over the course of the spring. They
discussed wide-ranging issues, which included legislative and regulatory obligations, the role of law
enforcement, freedom of expression and disinformation. Experts advised that a risk-based approach to
regulation, anchored in a duty to act responsibly, would be most appropriate, as it would inject
transparency and accountability into how online services address the harm that their services pose to
users. The work of the expert advisory group concluded on June 10, 2022, and summaries of their
discussions have been posted online.
Moreover, between June 15 and 19, 2022, the Citizen’s Assembly on Democratic Expression, composed
of participants from across Canada with a variety of backgrounds and representative of Canada’s
diversity, met to discuss the issue of a new legislative and regulatory framework to address harmful
content online. The Assembly reviewed the work of the expert panel and considered the measure the
Government should take to strengthen online safety, reduce disinformation and safeguard user rights.
The Assembly will issue a public report in late summer 2022.
Following the work of the Expert Advisory Group, Minister Rodriguez is currently conducting
roundtables on online safety to listen to and understand the perspectives of those who would be most
impacted by the legislation. Over the last months, roundtables have taken place in cities across Canada
including Charlottetown, Moncton, St. John’s, Québec City, Montréal, Edmonton and Saskatoon. More
engagement will be announced in the coming weeks.
Minister Rodriguez said his priority is getting it “right.” The legislation is expected to be tabled as soon
as feasible.
Several governments in other jurisdictions, such as Germany, Australia, France, the European Union, the
United Kingdom and New Zealand, have proposed or enacted legislation that imposes obligations on
online platforms to restrict certain forms of content and activity.
In 2019, as part of Canada’s approach to protecting its democracy, the Digital Citizen Initiative (DCI) was
created. Since January 2020, the Digital Citizenship Contributions Program (DCCP) has provided $8.6
million to third-party organizations that undertake research or learning activities, such as public
awareness tools and online workshops to help Canadians become more resilient and think critically
about the information they consume online. These projects reachCanadians nationally and locally,
online and offline, in minority communities, in both official languages and in Aboriginal communities.
Special COVID-19 calls were also made to enhance citizen preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the DCI was provided with $3.5 million in funding to amplify the efforts of ten organizations supporting
citizens to think critically about the health information they find online.
CANADA HEALTH ACT–ABORTION SERVICES (85 WORDS)
• ThisGovernment is committed to upholding the fundamental right to choose and believes that
no one should be forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy.
• Health Canada has taken action under the Canada Health Act to combat patient charges for
access to insured surgical abortion services by levying deductions to Ontario and New Brunswick’s
Canada Health Transfers.
• In addition to enforcing the Act, over $3.5 million of funding targeted at improving access to
abortion services has been announced through Budget 2021’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund.
IF PRESSED ON FURTHER COMPLIANCE ACTION UNDER THE CANADA HEALTH ACT (85 words)
• While abortion services are insured in all provinces and territories, there is still work to be done
to improve access in many areasof the country.
• Health Canada continues to work with Ontario on its Reimbursement Action Plan to ensure that
patients do not face financial barriers when accessing insured surgical abortion services.
• New Brunswick will continue to be subject to CanadaHealth Transfer deductions as long as the
province refuses to cover insured surgical abortion services provided at private clinics, resulting in
patient charges.
IF PRESSED ON THE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH FUND (78 words)
• This Government is committed to making sexual and reproductive health services more
accessible, with an emphasis on populations experiencing the highest risks and greatest barriers,
including Indigenous people, racialized populations, members of 2SLGBTQI+communities, women and
youth. That is why Budget 2021 committed $45 million over three years, directed to community-based
organizations that help to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care support, information,
and services for people in Canada who face the greatest barriers to access.
BACKGROUND
Health Canada’s top priority is to protect the health and safety of people in Canada, including women
who choose to end their pregnancy. The Government of Canada unequivocally supports the rightto
choose, and works to ensure that safe and legal abortion services are available to everyone. Abortion
services are deemed medically necessary and are insured in all provinces and territories. Individuals
should not face charges when seeking these insured services, regardless of where the services are
provided.
The Canada Health Act establishes criteria and conditions related to insured health services and
extended health care services that the provinces and territories must fulfill to receive the full federal
cash contribution under the Canada Health Transfer (CHT). The aim of the Act is to ensure that all
eligible residents of Canadian provinces and territories have reasonable access to medically necessary
hospital, physician, and surgical-dental services that require a hospital setting on a prepaid basis,
without charges related to the provision of insured health care services.
Roe v. Wade
On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. This decision repealed the US federal
constitutional protection for abortion services and now defers to the individual states to regulate
abortion services.
The overturning of Roe v. Wade has galvanized the discussion about access to abortion in Canada as well
as questions surrounding Americans from states with restrictive abortion laws crossing border to access
abortion services in Canada and possible implications for Canadian providers. Similar to other health
care services, Americans coming to Canada would be able to obtain safe abortion care in Canada, but
would have to pay for the service out-of-pocket. Media articles have reported an increase in phone
enquiries from Americans seeking information since the decision, but no increase in the booking of
appointments.
Access to Abortion in New Brunswick
In New Brunswick, Regulation 84-20 of the Medical Services Payment Act limits coverage of surgical
abortion services to approved hospitals (three NB hospitals currently offer the service–two in Moncton
and one in Bathurst). This means that individuals who receive these services at the private clinic in
Fredericton are required to pay out-of-pocket. New Brunswick is the only province with a private
abortion clinic (Clinic 554) where the province does not provide coverage for services. Patient charges
for abortion services received in private clinics are considered user charges under the Canada Health Act
and raise concerns under the accessibility and comprehensiveness criteria of the Act. Since March 2020,
deductions totaling $269,916 have been levied against the NB’s Canada Health Transfer (CHT) payments
in respect of patient charges for surgical abortion services. The lack of coverage for abortions performed
in private clinics has been discussed bilaterally with NB since 1995, without resolution. Currently, Clinic
554 appears to be operating one day per week, offering only surgical abortion services.
On January 6, 2021, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) filed a statement of claim in the NB
courts, as part of a Charter challenge against NB’s restrictive Regulation 84-20. The Association was
granted standing in the case by the NB Court of Queen’s bench on June 2, 2021. The group argues that
the regulation is inconsistent with and in violation of the Canada Health Act. The Association had
previously advised the province it would take legal action if the regulation was not amended to permit
coverage for abortion services received outside hospitals. The province filed their Statement of Defence
on July 2, 2021, which denied many of the CCLA’s allegations and indicated that Regulation 84-20 does
not violate the Canada Health Act.
The case is currently in the discovery phase and the CCLA is awaiting information from the province,
which was requested in January 2022. The CCLA has stated that if the information is not provided in a
timely matter they may bring forward a motion for the Court to compel the information. To date, no
trial date has been set. Following the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the CCLA wrote to the NB Government to
reiterate their position.
Access to Abortion in Ontario
In summer 2019, media stories in Ontario revealed fees charged to individuals to access surgical
abortion services in some private clinics. Health Canada followed up on these reports by analyzing clinic
websites, and by making phone or email inquiries to clinics of concern. While the Ontario Health
Insurance Plan provides coverage for physicians' fees related to abortion services in all private clinics,
the province only covers facility fees in the four private abortion clinics licensed as Independent Health
Facilities (IHF). Evidence gathered confirmed that some private non-IHF abortion clinics charged fees for
uninsured services, while not consistently informing patients these fees were optional, with respect to
accessinginsured surgical abortion services.
When the Ontario Health Ministry conducted further investigations, the patient charges discovered
were reported to Health Canada. These charges formed the basis of Ontario’s March 2021 and March
2022 deductions (totaling $20,465). In December 2021, Ontario submitted a Reimbursement Action Plan
to Health Canada, and has committed to revisit the current framework for the funding of insured
surgical abortion services in the province. Health Canada continues to engage with Ontario as it works to
implement its action plan and eliminate patient charges for access to abortion services and the province
will provide an updated status report in the coming months, which will be published in the Canada
Health Act Annual Report for 2021-2022.
Under the Canada Health Act Reimbursement Policy, which came into effect in 2018, provinces and
territories that face mandatory deductions have the opportunity to be reimbursed if they work with
Health Canada to develop a plan to eliminate patient charges for medically necessary services, and the
circumstances that led to them. The plan must be successfully implemented within a specified
timeframe (under the Reimbursement Policy, and as outlined in Section 25.01 of the Federal-Provincial
Fiscal Arrangements Act, a province has up to two years from the date of a deduction to be reimbursed).
Additional Federal Initiatives with Respect to Sexual and Reproductive Health
Health Canada’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund is advancing worknationwide to increase access
to sexual and reproductive health. Budget 2021 committed $45 million over three years, starting in
2021-2022, to improve access to sexual and reproductive health care support, information, and services
for people in Canada who face the greatest barriers to access.
Health Canada has announced more than $3.5 million in funding for two projects, coming out of the
Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund. These projects will improve access by removing barriers to vital
abortion services, including financial assistance for those travelling for abortion services, and offering
accurate reproductive health information to Canadians
PROVISION OF MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN THE WORKPLACE (139 WORDS)
• Menstrualproducts are essential to the health of workers, allowing them to participate fully in
the workforce and society at large.
• This is why the government convened a roundtable of experts on a potential proposal to amend
regulations under the Canada Labour Code to require federally regulated employers to provide
menstrual products in the workplace.
• A summary of findings from the roundtable was published online along with a survey asking for
feedback from Canadians. The Labour Program received over 700 responses from federally regulated
employers, employees, unions, and members of the public expressinga broad spectrum of opinions.
• We have initiated the regulatory process and will consult stakeholders in April 2022.
• This work will support my mandate commitment to lead the efforts for the provision of
menstrual products in federally regulated workplaces to help ensure employees’ participation in work.
IF PRESSED (42 words)
• Providing workers with access to menstrual products is expected to support better health
outcomes, and workplace productivity while helping to reduce the stigma and shame often associated
with menstruation, which continues to persist despite the progress we have made towards gender
equality.
BACKGROUND
Current regulations underPart II of the Canada Labour Code (the Code) require employers to provide
supplies such as toilet paper, soap, warm water, and a means to dry hands. No requirements are
currently in place to require employers to provide menstrual products.
There has beenincreasing public awareness and acknowledgement that menstrual products constitute
necessary items that are essential to the health of a large proportion of Canadians.
This issue is linked to a broader movement aimed at ending the stigma and shame associated with
menstruation, and ensuring that every person can access essential menstrual products as needed. In
fact, public awareness was further increased in November 2020, when Scotland passed the Period
Products (Free Provision) (Scotland) Act and becamethe first country in the world to provide universal
access to menstrual products.
Lack of access to menstrual products can hinder employees’ ability to participate fully in society,
including in the labour force. Health risks are increased when employeesfind themselves without access
to menstrual products. Employees in this situation are often forced to turn to unsuitable solutions such
as improvising tampons and pads from toilet paper or paper towels, or extending the use of the
products beyond their recommended timeframe, which increases the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. In
some situations, employees may avoid the workplace all together due to the shame and stigma that
often surrounds menstruation.
For employees in remote locations, the negative impact to their physical and psychological health may
be heightened due to greater barriers, such as higher costs of and the lack of accessibility to menstrual
products. The cost of menstrual products varies significantly from location to location in Canada, and the
financial burden is borne exclusively by menstruating employees.
The provision of menstrual products by employers may contribute to relieving the health risks that
employees may face related to lack of access to menstrual products in the workplace.
To begin consultations, a Notice of Intent was published in Part I of the Canada Gazette on May 4, 2019,
for a period of 60 days to provide a range of stakeholders with the opportunity to submit comments
regarding the Labour Program’s proposal.
The Labour Program received 42 submissions during the consultation period; 13 from labour
organizations and federal and provincial employer groups and 29 from individual Canadians. The
feedback that was received indicated neither strong support nor disapproval ofthe proposal. At this
time, neither employer nor employee stakeholders have listed this topic as a priority occupational
health and safety item. The Notice of Intent did help create a broader public dialogue on this important
issue.
On December 21,2020, the Government of Canada published a What We Heard report outlining the
feedback that was received in response to the Notice of Intent.
As part of its commitment to assess possible amendments to require federally regulated employers to
provide menstrual products in the workplace, the Labour Program convened a roundtable of experts on
June 8, 2021. Twelve experts who have experience in developing, implementing and/or evaluating
policies or initiatives participated.
A summary of findings from the roundtable of experts was published and a survey was launched online
for public feedback on August 3, 2021, and closed on September 7, 2021. 734 Canadians completed the
survey.
On December 16, 2021, the Minister of Labour was mandated to lead the efforts to provide menstrual
products in federally regulated workplaces to help ensure employee’s participation in work.
The Labour Program has initiated the regulatory process and is preparing to conduct stakeholder
consultations in April 2022.
BIRTH CONTROL (76 WORDS)
• The Government of Canada recognizes that all Canadians should have access to a full suite of
sexual and reproductive health resources and services, no matter where they live.
• To improve access to sexual and reproductive health care support, information, and services–
including protecting access to abortion care–Budget 2021 provided $45 million overthree years, as of
April 2021.
The Government of Canada is committed to continue working with willing provinces and territories
towards national pharmacare.
BACKGROUND
On May 4th, 2022, the New Democratic Party (NDP) called on the federal government to improve
abortion services and make contraceptives free for all Canadians.This includes ensuring that
contraceptives are in the formulary of medications initially launched with national pharmacare.
Budget 2021 Funding Supporting Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Care Information and
Services
To improve access to sexualand reproductive health care support, information, and services–including
protecting access to abortion care–Budget 2021 provided $45 million over three years, directed to
community-based organizations that help to make sexual and reproductive health information and
services more accessible for populations experiencing the highest risks and greatest barriers in relation
to sexual and reproductive health, including Indigenous people, racialized people, members of
2SLGBTQI+ communities, and youth.
Opposition Motion on Sexual And Reproductive Health Services
On June 15, 2016, NDP MP Irene Mathyssen motioned for the federal government to improve sexual
and reproductive health services in Canada, including negotiating with provincial governments to cover
thecosts of all prescribed contraceptives. M-65, Sexual And Reproductive Health Services, was placed
on notice.
Private Member’s Bill on Pharmacare
On February 24, 2020, NDP MP Peter Julian tabled Private Member’s Bill C-213, An Act to Enact the
Canada Pharmacare Act, in the House of Commons. This bill would provide for a legislative framework
for a public single-payer drug coverage system in Canada. On February 24, 2021, Bill C-213 was defeated
on second reading with a vote of 295 against and 32 for.
Opposition Motion on Pharmacare
On March 13, 2020, the House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion from NDP MP Don Davies
(Vancouver Kingsway, BC) that called on the government to negotiate with the PTs to establish a
dedicated fiscal transfer for universal,single-payer, public pharmacare. The motion was passed with the
Government’s support.
Supply and Confidence Agreement
The agreement announced on March 22, 2022, committed to continuing progress towards a national
pharmacare program by passing a Canada Pharmacare Act by the end of 2023 and then tasking the
National Drug Agency [Canadian Drug Agency] to develop a national formulary of essential medicines
and bulk purchasing plan by the end of the agreement (June 2025). This commitment was reflected in
Budget2022.
Provincial and Territorial Coverage for Contraceptives
All provinces and territories (PTs) provide some form of public coverage for contraceptives. However,
eligibility and affordability varies depending on the public plan, with some plans having high deductibles
and out-of-pocket costs. Many PT public plans only cover certain populations such as low-income
households, children and seniors. Furthermore, not all PT plans cover all contraceptive methods. Public
drug plans generally all list oral contraceptives (OC) as a benefit, but offer less consistency for other
forms such as patches, injectables, vaginal rings and medicated intra-uterine devices (IUD) and systems
(IUS).
While most Canadians have access to some form of drug coverage, the terms of coverage for both public
and private plans mean many still face significant out-of-pocket costs. This can result in Canadians
paying high up-front costs for contraceptives or go without (e.g. $140/year for oral contraceptives).
Nearly all PTs provide some form of coverage for the abortion medication Mifegymiso but the
conditions of this coverage vary. Currently nine provincial and territorial public health insurance plans
(PEI,NB, NS, QC, ON, MB, SK, AB, BC, and YK) provide universal no-cost coverage of the drug to residents
where a public/private drug coverage plan is not required for access. NL and NWT provide full coverage
of the drug for individuals with no private insurance, with NL also covering the remainder once a
resident has used their private insurance. Nunavut is the only jurisdiction that does not cover the drug
through any PT program, although the majority of Nunavut residents (~92%) are eligible for coverage
underthe Non-insured Health Benefits Program (NIHB) of the federal government. In six provinces (NS,
NL, ON, MB, SK and BC), prescriptions from nurse practitioners are eligible for coverage.
Other forms of emergency contraceptives such as levonorgestrel (e.g., Plan B or a generic equivalent)
are an over-the-counter drug and retails for $30-$40 plus tax if it is not covered through a public or
private plan. Some PTs (e.g. ON and QC) do reimburse this drug through a public plan if the resident
provides the prescription receipt.

practices, carry out public awareness activities, and provide travel and logistical support to access
abortion care.
• Budget 2021 committed $45 million to advancing sexual and reproductive health. To date, $24.9
million has been allocated. Nine projects, valued at $15.3 million, are underway. Of these nine projects,
two address access to abortion, five address 2SLGBTQI+ communities, two address youth. Two of the
nine projects include components focusing on Indigenous peoples. In addition, per capita funding of
$9.7M has been allocated to the Province of Québec to support community-based organizations located
in Québec.

Canadians.
IF PRESSED ON ABORTION SERVICES (109WORDS)
• Our Government believes that Canadians should have access to the full range of reproductive
health services, including abortion services.
• This Government will uphold the Canada Health Act to help ensure that patients do not face
barriers when accessing medically necessary health care.
• Of the $45 Million committed in Budget 2021, the Government of Canada has invested $3.6M to
date to support access to abortion for people in Canada who face the greatest barriers to care. In the
first six monthsof funding Action Canada provided 234% greater levels of financial support, and for a
208% increase in number of people supported, as compared to the same period in 2021.
IF PRESSED ON WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO ORGANIZATIONS OFFERING
ALTERNATIVES TO ABORTION (I.E. CONTINUING THE PREGNANCY) (39 WORDS)
• This fund is specifically designed to help women access abortion and it will not support
initiatives that discourage or are opposed to freedom of choice or attempt to override the individual’s
right to make decisions about their own body.
BACKGROUND
The Government of Canada has made strong commitments to gender equality, using a feminist lens, and
realizing and protecting sexual and reproductive health rights.
Key barriers and challenges related to inequitable and variable access to sexual and reproductive health
services remain. Women, members of 2SLGBTQI+ communities, youth, racialized Canadians and
Indigenous peoples face the highest sexual and reproductive health risks and the greatest barriers to
accessing support, information, and services.
An initial targeted call for proposals inviting select organizations to submit applications for funding was
launched on July 29th, 2021 and closed October 4, 2021. Nine contribution agreements have been
signed. A second targeted Call for Proposals was launched on July 12, 2022 and closed on September
16th. Further funding decisions will be made in the coming months.
Canada’s current national-level data on sexual and reproductive health is limited to a narrow range of
indicators. There is insufficient data available to support understanding and evidence-based decision-
making to address a full range of key indicators of sexual and reproductive health, including prevalence
of sexually transmitted infections, contraception use, pregnancy intention, and sexual knowledge and
behaviours.
Patient charges for abortion services
Although access to abortion services in Canada has been improved by the approval and roll-out of
Mifegymiso for medical abortion, the availability of surgical abortion varies both between provinces and
territories and nationally. Health Canada is aware of coverage issues resulting in patient charges for
surgical abortion services in a limited number of private clinics in bothNew Brunswick and Ontario.
Patient charges for abortion services received in private clinics are considered user charges under the
Canada Health Act.
In New Brunswick, Regulation 84-20 of the NB Medical Services Payment Act limits coverage of surgical
abortion services to approved hospitals (three NB hospitals currently offer the service–two in Moncton
and one in Bathurst). This means that individuals who receive these services at the private clinic in
Fredericton are required to pay out-of-pocket. NewBrunswick is the only province with a private

deductions totaling $269,916 have been levied against the NB’s Canada Health Transfer (CHT) payments
in respect of patient charges for surgical abortion services. The lack of coverage for abortions performed
in private clinics has been discussed bilaterally with NB since 1995, without resolution. Currently, Clinic
554 appears to be operating one day per week, offering only surgical abortion services.

deductions (totaling $20,465). In December 2021, Ontario submitted a Reimbursement Action Plan to
Health Canada, and has committed to revisit the current framework for the funding of insured surgical
abortion services in the province. Health Canada continues to engage with Ontario as it works to
implement its action plan and eliminate patient charges for access to abortion services and the province
willprovide an updated status report in the coming months, which will be published in the Canada
Health Act Annual Report for 2021-2022.
Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization in the United States
The U.S. Supreme Court, in rendering their decision in the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization, held that the Constitution of the United States does not confer any right to abortion,
overruling the decisions in Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1993) that prohibit
U.S. states frompassing legislation criminalizing abortion. This decision will make it possible for states to
criminalize abortion at their discretion.
There has been concern in Canada about Americans coming to Canada seeking abortion care, potentially
overwhelming limited Canadian resources. Since many states, including several on the U.S.-Canadian
border, have announced their intention to protect abortion services, a large influx of American patients
seems unlikely. Similar to other health care services, Americans coming to Canada would be able to
obtain safe abortion care in Canada, but would have to pay for the service out-of-pocket. Media articles
have reported an increase in phone enquiries from Americans seeking information since the decision,
but no increase in the booking of appointments.
Because of differences between the American and Canadian legislative and judicial systems, the
Canadian legal context for abortion is distinct. In Canada, following the Supreme Court of Canada’s
decision in R. v. Morgentaler (1988), abortion was decriminalized in Canada. There is therefore no
regulation at the federal level regarding abortion. As with other health care, abortion service delivery is
managed at the provincial or territorial level.

BACKGROUND
Cannabis
On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into force, legalizing, strictlyregulating and restricting
access to cannabis in Canada. The Act implements a new comprehensive public health approach that
will be more effective in protecting youth and keeping profits out of the pockets of criminals and
organized crime.
The Cannabis Act creates a legal and regulatory framework for controlling the production, distribution,
sale and possession of cannabis in Canada. This framework was informed by the recommendations of
the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation.
The Act restricts youth access to cannabis; prohibits promotions that are designed to encourage youth
to use cannabis; imposes serious criminal penalties on people who break the law, especially those who
import or export cannabis illegally, or provide cannabis to youth; establishes strict product safety and
quality requirements; reduces the burden on the criminal justice system; provides for the legal
production of cannabis; allows adults to possess and access regulated, quality-controlled, legal cannabis;
and, enhancespublic awareness of the health risks associated with cannabis.
Implementation is a shared responsibility between the federal, provincial and territorial governments.
Subject to provincial or territorial restrictions, adults may legally: purchase limited amounts of fresh
cannabis, dried cannabis, cannabis oil, cannabis seeds, or cannabis plants from retailers authorized by
the provinces and territories; possess up to 30 grams of dried legal cannabis or equivalent in non-dried
form in public; consume cannabis in locations authorized by local jurisdictions; grow up to four cannabis
plants per household (not per person) for personal use, from licensed seeds or seedlings from licensed
suppliers; share up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or equivalent with other adults; and, make legal
cannabis-containing products at home, such as food and drinks, provided that dangerous organic
solvents are not used in making them.
Possession, production, distribution and sale outside the legal system remains illegal and subject to
criminal penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, ranging from ticketing up to a
maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment.
To further protect youth, the Cannabis Act prohibits anyone from selling or providing cannabis to any
person under the age of 18 years. The Cannabis Act creates two new criminal offences, with maximum
penalties of 14 years in jail for: giving or selling cannabis to youth; and, using a youth to commit a
cannabis-related offence.
To prevent youth from using cannabis, the Cannabis Act also prohibits: products, promotions, packaging
and labelling that are appealing to youth; the sale of cannabis through self-service displays or vending
machines; promotion of cannabis, except in narrow circumstances where the promotion could not be
seen by a young person; and, false, misleading or deceptive advertising, sponsorships, testimonials and
endorsements or other forms of promotion that could entice young people to use cannabis.
Driving while impaired by cannabis, or any otherdrug, is illegal. Law enforcement officers are trained to
detect and deter drug-impaired drivers using Standardized Field Sobriety Testing and Drug Recognition
Experts.
Border rules have not changed. Taking cannabis, or any product containing cannabis, across Canada’s
international borders, whether you are leaving or entering Canada, remains illegal and can result in
serious criminal penalties both at home and abroad. Cannabis is illegal in most countries. Previous use of
cannabis, or any substance prohibited by local law, could result in a traveller being denied entry to his or
her destination country.
Legislative Review
The Cannabis Act requires that the Minister initiate a review of the Act and its administration three
years following the coming intoforce of the Act (i.e., after October 17, 2021), and that a report of the
review’s findings be tabled before both Houses of Parliament within 18 months of the start of the
review.
The Cannabis Act further stipulates that the review must include an assessment of the impact of the
Cannabis Act on public health and, in particular, on: the health and consumption habits of young
persons in respect of cannabis use; Indigenous persons and communities; and, the cultivation of
cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.
On September 22, 2022, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions
launched the legislative review of the Act. An Expert Panel, chaired by Morris Rosenberg, will lead the
review, and a report including findings or recommendations resulting from the review will be tabled in
both Houses of Parliament within 18 months.
On September 22, 2022, an online engagement process to gather perspectives from the public,
stakeholders and Indigenous groups on the cannabis framework was launched. The results will inform
the Panel’s work.
The Government of Canada has made progress toward the implementation of the cannabis framework
by putting in place measures aimed at protecting children and youth from accessing cannabis;
establishing a strictly regulated, legal supply chain for cannabis, and by making significant investments in
public education, awareness, research, monitoring and surveillance efforts.
The review provides an initial and early opportunity to assess progress towards achieving the objectives
of the Act, and to help ensure that the legislation is meeting the needs and expectations of Canadians
through a credible, evidence-driven review process.
Medical Access Framework
Medical Regime
Health Canada administers the medicalaccess program under the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis
Regulations.
As of August 31, 2022, there were more than 233,000 patients registered with federally licensed sellers
(Note: these are not always unique individuals as individuals may be registeredwith more than one
licensed seller, provided an original medical document was used with each registration).
As of September 2022, there were more than 21,000 individuals registered with Health Canada for
personal and designated production of cannabis fortheir own medical purposes.
Licensed cannabis producers must pay a federal excise duty when they package cannabis products,
including those sold to patients for medical purposes. Federal policies related to excise duties on
cannabis fall under the purview of the Minister of Finance.
Authorizations for personal or designated production
Canadians who have been authorized by their health care practitioner can access cannabis for medical
purposes by producing cannabis or by designating someone to produce it for them.
Personal and designated production are subject to regulatory requirements, which are designed to
ensure that cannabis is consumed only with the approval and under the supervision of an authorized
health care practitioner.
Health Canada reviews all applications for personal or designated production to ensure that the
regulatory requirements are met. Health Canada also confirms that the health care practitioner is
authorized by—and in good standing with—the relevant provincial or territorialregulatory health
authority, and that the medical document is an original that has not been altered or falsified.
Once a registration certificate is issued, the personal or designated producer may not produce in excess
of the maximum limits outlined ina registration certificate, and may not sell cannabis to any person.
Selling cannabis without authorization is a criminal offence.
A maximum of four registrations are permitted per production site. Only the individuals authorized to
produce cannabis for their own medical purposes, or the person designated to produce it for them, can
tend to the plants.
Health Canada appreciates that, as in any regulatory framework, there will be instances where
individuals choose to operate outside of the law. Health Canada supports law enforcement
representatives on a daily basis by providing a dedicated service 24 hours a day and seven days a week
to confirm, when necessary, that specific individuals are authorized to produce cannabis for medical
purposes.
Health Canada has the ability to inspect a production site if it is not the registrant’s home to ensure it is
abiding by the terms set out in the individual’s registration certificate.
Health Products Containing Cannabis
Within this cannabis legislative framework, two prescription drugs containing cannabis and one
synthetic cannabinoid have been approved for sale. Sativex contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and
cannabidiol (CBD), and Marinol contains THC. Sativex is available to Canadian patients, but Marinol was
voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer in 2012.
Health Canada currently has a submission under review for a drug containing THC (dronabinol).
Drugs containing the synthetic cannabinoid nabilone have also been approved. Nabilone, a synthetic
cannabinoid which does not exist in nature, is not captured by the definition of cannabis in the Cannabis
Act, and remains scheduled under the CDSA as a narcotic.
There are currently no authorized veterinary drugs containing cannabis.
Non-Therapeutic Research with Cannabis
Since the Cannabis Act and its regulations first came into force, stakeholders have indicated that the
clinical trial framework has resulted in challenges in conducting non-therapeutic research on cannabis.
Currently, most non-therapeutic research on cannabis involving human participants is considered a
“clinical trial” under the Food and Drug Regulations.Many researchers have had difficulty securing
authorization under the Food and Drug Regulations using legal, regulated cannabis products available
for purchase by adult consumers. These difficulties have led to missed opportunities to advance the
knowledgeand evidence base about cannabis, including its effects and uses in a non-therapeutic
context.
Health Canada is proposing to create a new framework under the Cannabis Regulations to facilitate
research on cannabis in humans for non-medical purposes to increase the knowledge about cannabis
and the risks of using cannabis products and to reduce the regulatory burden on stakeholders. The
proposed amendments would facilitate such research by solely regulating them under a cannabis
research licence issued under the Cannabis Regulations.
Research with cannabis for therapeutic purposes will continue to be regulated under the clinical trial
framework under the Food and Drugs Regulations will continue to be conducted with the same level of
rigour and concern forpatient safety.
President Biden Pardoning all Federal Offenses of Simple Cannabis Possession
On October 6, 2022, U.S. President Biden announced that he is pardoning all prior federal offenses of
simple cannabis possession, and called on state Governors to do the same at the state level. This does
not apply to charges for trafficking.
The White House estimates that 6,500 people with prior federal convictions and thousands of such
convictions under Washington, DC lawcould benefit from this relief.
This decision does not legalize or decriminalize cannabis in the US, but it does representa shift away
from the War on Drugs approach tocannabis at the federal level.
In the U.S., cannabis is currently a Schedule 1 drug, the same schedule as heroin, fentanyl and other
dangerous narcotics. The review by the FDA could take years and reclassification of cannabis is not
guaranteed.
On August 1, 2019, Bill C-93, An Act to provide a no-cost expedited record suspension process for simple
possession of cannabis, which received royal assent on June 21, 2019, came into force. The Act modifies
the Criminal Records Act to waive record suspension application wait periods and application fees for
those convicted only of simple possession of cannabis. The Act creates an administrative review process
where the application is considered by a Parole Board of Canada (PBC) staff member as opposed to a
discretionary review by PBC Board Members. The record suspension will be ordered so long as the
individual can show that their only convictions are for simple possession of cannabis.

2SLGBTQI+ HEALTH (114 words)
• The Government of Canada is committed to addressing stigma and discrimination against
2SLGBTQI+ populations and reducing the social and health inequities that they face.
• Our focus is on creating inclusive environments where everyone feels seen,safe, respected and
welcomed.
• Thiswork is important because we know that intersecting systems of discrimination create
barriers to employment, housing, social support, health, and social services, and threaten the personal
safety and overall well-being of 2SLGBTQI+ individuals.
• To address the unique needs of these populations, we are investing in research, health
promotion and disease prevention programs, as well as initiatives to improve health care. This includes
programs to address mental health, gender-based violence and sexual andreproductive health.
BACKGROUND
2SLGBTQI+ and other marginalized populations experience worse health outcomes across a range of
issues. These health inequities are the result of persistent, inequitable social and economic conditions
for these groups. These impacts are amplified for Indigenous and racialized 2SLGBTQI+ populations
affected by the intersecting impacts of colonialism and racism.
Mental health: Worse outcomes for 2SLGBTQI+ people have been reported across a range of indicators,
including (but not limited to) mental health. For example, the prevalence of low self-rated mental health
among bisexual adults is 3 times that of heterosexual adults; among gay/lesbian adults it is 1.7 times
that of heterosexual adults.
Suicide: 2SLGBTQI+ people inCanada are more likely to contemplate suicide in their lifetime
(approximately 40% of LGB Canadians vs 15% of heterosexual Canadians).
Substance use: 24% of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and other non-heterosexual respondents to the 2018
Survey of Safety in Public and Private Spaces reported having used drugs or alcohol to cope with
experiences of emotional abuse and physical violence, versus 10% of heterosexual respondents.
Chronic disease: Higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, some types of cancer and respiratory
diseases among 2SLGBTQI+ communities, with the onset of chronic diseases also happening earlier in
life.
Barriers accessing healthcare: Experiences of discrimination within the healthcare system sometimes
cause 2SLGBTQI+ people to avoid seeking healthcare in the first place. For example, 12% of respondents
to the Trans PULSE survey had avoided the emergency room in the previous year, despite needing care,
and 45% reported having unmet healthcare needs within the same period.
Historical andongoing injustices endured by 2SLGBTQI+, Indigenous, racialized, immigrant, and disabled
populations, and women, have created persistent, inequitable social and economic conditions for these
groups. Consequently, 2SLGBTQI+ and other marginalized populations experience stigma, discrimination
and worse health outcomes across a range of issues. These health inequities are amplified for
Indigenous and racialized 2SLGBTQI+ populations affected by the intersecting impacts of colonialism and
racism.
Gay, lesbian and bisexual Canadians experience substantial inequities in self-rated health and mental
health, household food insecurity, smoking, heavy drinking, asthma, arthritis, and HIV infection.
Canadian studies have also revealed significant socioeconomic inequities facing 2SLGBTQI+ populations,
including in income, employment and workplace stress, as well as experiences of violence, hate crimes,
and discrimination. Suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts are disproportionately prevalent among
2SLGBTQI+youth compared to non-2SLGBTQI+ peers.
Recent Developments to Support 2SLGBTQI+
Blood Donor Deferral Period for Men who have sex with Men
There are two blood system operators in Canada–Canadian Blood Services (serving all provinces and
territories except Québec) and Héma-Québec (serving the province of Québec). Both are regulated by
Health Canada.
On September 11, 2022, Canadian Blood Services eliminated the three month blanket donor deferral
period for all sexually active men who have sex with men,and instead began screening all donors,
regardless of gender or sexuality, for high risk sexual behaviour. Health Canada authorized this change
towards more inclusive screening on April 28, 2022. The Government of Canada provided $5.4M,
starting in 2016, to support the necessary research to effect this change.
In March 2022, Health Canada approved a submission from Héma-Québec to move to sexual-behaviour
based screening for all source plasma donors. On October 2, 2022, Héma-Québec replaced their plasma
donation questionnaire with a gender-neutral questionnaire, using the same questions as those
authorized for Canadian Blood Services for use in the rest of Canada.
On September 6, 2022, Health Canada authorized Héma-Québec’s submission to eliminate the three
month blanket donor deferral period for all sexually active men who have sex with men, and others
impacted by this process, and to begin screening all blood, platelet, and plasma donors, regardless of
gender or sexuality for high risk sexual behaviour. Gender neutral, behaviour-based screening for blood
and platelets will take effect on December 4, 2022.
Moreover, non-binary and transgender donors must presently be evaluated by Héma-Québec medical
staff for donation eligibility prior to attending blood drives. As of December 4, 2022, anyone wishing to
donate blood products through Héma-Québec will answer the same questions regardless of sex or
gender identity, and an evaluation by a Héma-Québec medical staff member will no longer be required.
Monkeypox
Community-based organizations have been an important source of expertise regarding health
promotion, disease prevention, and culturally responsive communications for the Government’s
response to monkeypox. The virus continues to be an ongoing concern, andmore work remains to be
done. As of August 12, 2022, Public Health Agency of Canada has invested $900,000 in new investments
through the HIV and Hepatitis C Community Action Fund to the Community Based Research Centre
(CBRC), H.I.M. Health Initiative for Men Society in Vancouver, the Queer and Trans Health Collective in
Edmonton, The AIDS Committee of Toronto, RÉZO Montreal, and the Ottawa Gay Men’s Wellness
Initiative (MAX Ottawa) to increase the capacity of communities in the regions most impacted by the
monkeypox outbreak.
AIDS 2022
On August 1, 2022 at the AIDS 2022 conference hosted by Canada, the Government of Canada
announced a time-limited (September 2022–March 2023) investment of $8 million to acquire HIV self-
test kits and support community-based organizations.
Health Portfolio Initiatives
The Health Portfolio currently supports the health of 2SLGBTQI+ populations through a range of both
targeted and inclusive initiatives, and will seek opportunities to strengthen these efforts as the
2SLGBTQI+Action Plan evolves over its 5-year timeline. Some of these initiatives include:
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC):
1) Data and surveillance initiatives, such as the Pan-Canadian Health Inequalities Reporting
Initiative and enhanced surveillance through funding support for the Sex Now Survey;
2) Education and training initiatives, such as the Agency’s involvement in updating the “Pride
Guide” resource for 2SLGBTQI+ youth in Canada;
3) Funding programs that have supported 2SLGBTQI+ projects, including the Mental Health
Promotion Innovation Fund (2 targeted projects), the HIV and Hepatitis C Community Action Fund (23
targeted projects), the Preventing Gender-Based Violence initiative (5 targeted projects), the Mental
Health of Black Canadians Fund (3 targeted projects), the Dementia Community Investment (1 targeted
project), and the Harm Reduction Fund (3 targeted projects);
4) Research and knowledge translation initiatives, such as the Canadian Research and Knowledge
Translation Agenda on Suicide and its Prevention, which includes a focus on 2SLGBTQI+ populations; and
5) Emergency preparedness and response, such as the $900,000 investment from the HIV and
Hepatitis C Community Action Fund to increase capacity of 2SLGBTQI+ community organizations in the
regions most impacted by the monkeypox outbreak.
Health Canada:
1) Funding programs that have supported, or are anticipated to support projects focused on
2SLGBTQI+ populations. The Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund ($45 million over 3 years, starting in
2021/22) has a strong emphasis on initiatives focusing on 2SLGBTQI+ populations; of the first 9 projects
that were funded, 5 focus on 2SLGBTQI+ populations, for a total dollar value of $8.8 million. Additional
funding programs supporting 2SLGBTQI+ populations include the Substance Use and Addictions Program
($100 million over 3 years, starting in 2022/23); and the Addressing Racism and Discrimination in
Canada’s Health Systems Program ($14.9 million over three years, beginning in 2021/22); and
2) Broader initiatives to improve access to care, which do not focus on 2SLGBTQI+ populations, but
include the populations through an SGBA Plus lens, such as the Action Plan on Palliative Care, National
Standards for Mental Health Services, National Standards for Long Term Care, the Task Team on
Equitable Access to Virtual Care, and Wellness Together Canada.
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR):
1) CIHR supports research and knowledge mobilization related to 2SLGBTQI+ health, including
through the following time-limited priority-driven research initiatives:
• Catalyst and support grants for Community-Led Research on LGBTQIA/2S Wellness;
• The Health Research Training Platform on Stigma Reduction and Life Course Mental Wellness for
LGBTQ/2S Populations (co-funded with PHAC and Egale);
• The CIHR Sex and Gender Science Chair-LGBTQI2S Wellness and Resilience;
• The Transitions in Care initiative, which includes research that will inform how healthcare teams
can collaboratively work with intersex individuals across Canada in an effort to improve lifelong
wellbeing within this population across several transitions in care;
• The Indigenous Gender and Wellness Initiative, which includes research toimprove wellness of
Indigenous Two-Spirit and LGBTQI+ individuals and communities;
• Catalyst Grants for Healthy Youth, which includes dedicated funding for 2SLGBTQI+ youth (Note:
this competition is currently underway with results expected in March 2023);
• Transforming Health with Integrated Care Implementation Science Team Grants, including
projects related to gender-affirming health (Note: this competition is currently underway with results
expected in April 2023);
• CIHR recently launched the NationalWomen’s Health Research Initiative in partnership with the
Department of Women and Gender Equality (WAGE). This will invest $20 million over five years to
advance a coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-priority areas of
women's health. The initiative promotes an intersectional lens to research and care to tackle persistent
gaps for all women, including members of 2SLGBTQI+ communities.
2) CIHR also continues to advance measures to promote equity, diversity and inclusion within the
research ecosystem, including for/with 2SLGBTQI+ researchers and trainees, for example through
commitments to further gender equity in CIHR’s strategic plan and the Tri-Agency Equity, Diversity and
Inclusion Action Plan.
2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan
OnAugust 28, 2022, the Government of Canada launched the first-ever federal 2SLGBTQI+ Action Plan,
which seeks to improve the social, economic and health outcomes of 2SLGBTQI+ populations in Canada
through a whole-of-government approach. WAGE is the federallead on the Action Plan.
The historic $100 million Budget 2022 investment in the Action Plan, allocated entirely to WAGE, will
support activities such as community capacity, anti-stigma, awareness and research–all of which will
advance meaningful actionon the social determinants of health and have a positive impact on the
health of 2SLGBTQI+ populations.
The Health Portfolio’s current initiatives to support 2SLGBTQI+ populations also contribute to the Action
Plan’s objectives, but more work remains to bedone. The Health Portfolio will continue to work with
federal partners such as WAGE to advance the priorities of the Action Plan and related Government of
Canada equity initiatives, such as Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy 2.0, Canada’s Action Plan on
Combatting Hate, and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls 2SLGBTQIA+ National
Action Plan.

BACKGROUND
The mandate letters of the Ministers of Mental Health and Addiction and Indigenous Services Canada
include the commitment Services “to co-develop and invest in a distinctions-based Mental Health and
Wellness Strategy to meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation, including culturally
appropriate wraparound services for addiction and trauma,suicide and life promotion and the building
of treatment centres”.
Improving mental wellness for First Nations, Inuit and Métis is a key priority for Indigenous leaders,
organizations and communities. This is a priority shared by the Government of Canada. Addressing this
issue is challenging. It needs a holistic, Indigenous-specific, strength-based, distinctions-based,
community-driven approach which supports people, families, and communities. It also needs to address
the legacy of residential schools, the sixties’ scoop, and other devastating impacts of colonization as well
as focus on the social determinants of health such as education, health care, culture, language, and self-
determination.
The Government of Canada has made significant recent investments to improve mental wellness in
Indigenous communities, including an approximate annual investment of $645 million in 2021-22
through Indigenous Services Canada’s Mental Wellness Program. These investments are made to meet
the immediate mental wellness needs of communities by supporting Indigenous-led suicide prevention,
life promotion and crisis response, including through crisis line intervention services, and enhancing the
delivery of culturally-appropriate substance use treatment and prevention services in Indigenous
communities. This funding also supports the provision of essential cultural, emotional, and mental
health support to former Indian Residential School and federal Day School students and their families as
well as those affected by the issueof Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.
Part of these recent investments include funding specific to distinctions-based approaches to mental
wellness services, including investments through Budget 2021 of $597.6 million over three years, and
$227.6 million over two years in Budget 2022. A further $107M was announced in August 2021 for
trauma informed health services in response to the confirmation of unmarked burials at Residential
Schools.
The Government of Canada works closely with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners to improve mental
wellness for Indigenous populations in Canada. While collaborations with First Nations and Inuit on
mental wellness at national, regional and community levels is long-standing, partnerships with Métis
haveonly recently been initiated as a result of new funding through Budget 2021. Previous to Budget
2021, the only Métis specific funding for mental wellness was a result of an investment of $82.5 million
announced in August 2020 to support First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities in adapting services to
meet mental wellness needs resulting from the pandemic.
Indigenous Services Canada is guided by three key Indigenous-led mental wellness strategies, namely
the First Nations Mental Wellness Continuum Framework, Honouring Our Strengths and the National
Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy. These documents outline a holistic approach to mental wellness that is
grounded in culture and Indigenous-specific determinants of health.
First Nations leaders, partners andcommunities see the First Nations Mental Wellness Continuum
Framework and Honouring Our Strengths as the key strategies for First Nations mental wellness.
Similarly, Inuit leaders, partners and communities see the National Inuit Suicide Prevention Strategy as
the key strategy for Inuit mental wellness. Implementation of these distinctions-based strategies is an
essential priority for partners to make progress on distinctions-based approaches to improving mental
wellness among First Nations and Inuit. Thereis currently no Métis-specific strategy for mental wellness.
The Government of Canada recognizes that the COVID 19 pandemic is having profound impacts on
mental wellness in Indigenous communities by magnifying existing mental health issues and inequities
and creating new gaps and needs. This is a key priority for the Government of Canada. Many mental
wellness services continue to be accessible with some experiencing breaks in service, shifts in service
delivery, or new innovative approaches to reach community members. The Minister of Indigenous
Services Canada announced an investment of $82.5M in August 2020 to help Indigenous communities
adapt and expand mental wellness services, improving access and addressing growing demand, in the
context of the pandemic.
ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION (115 words)
• The Government of Canada is committed to protecting children and to preventing online child
sexual exploitation.
• Public Safety Canada has been leading the NationalStrategy for the Protection of children from
Sexual Exploitation on the Internet since 2004, in partnership with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
Justice Canada and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, anot-for-profit organization.
• New investments through Budgets 2019 and 2021 complement ongoing funding of over $18
million annually for National Strategy partners. This includes support forCybertip.ca, the national tip-
line where Canadians can report suspected cases of online child sexual exploitation, and project
Arachnid, a web-crawling technology to identify and increase the rate of removal of child sexual abuse
material.
IF PRESSED ON INVESTMENTS (77 words)
• Budget 2019 included new investments of $22.24 million over three years to support Canada’s
efforts to raise awareness of this serious issue, reduce the stigma associated with reporting, increase
our ability to pursue and prosecute offenders, and work with digital industry to find new ways to
combat this crime.
• Budget 2021 proposed to provide $20.7 million over five years for the RCMP National Child
Exploitation Crime Centre to enhance its ability to combat online child sexual exploitation.
BACKGROUND
Online child sexual exploitation (OCSE) is one of the digital age’s most pressing safety issues that
continues to increase in terms of scope, reach and impacts. The sexual exploitation of children is a
heinous crime, and is a serious concern for the Government, law enforcement agencies and partners in
other orders of government and internationally.
The National Strategy for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet (National
Strategy) was launched in April 2004 and was renewed on an ongoing basis in 2009. Public Safety
Canada (PS) is the lead for the National Strategy and partners with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
(RCMP), Justice Canada (JUS) and the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P), a not-for-profit
organization responsible for operating Cybertip.ca, the national tip-line.
PS coordinates and oversees the implementation of the National Strategy and leads the development of
OCSE policy. PS also provides contribution funding to C3P for the operation ofCybertip.ca.The RCMP’s
National Child Exploitation Crime Centre is the national law enforcement arm of the National Strategy; it
is the central point of contact for investigations related to OCSE across the country and internationally
when the victim or offender is Canadian. JUS reviews and develops legislation, and provides training,
legal advice and support to federal strategy partners and others. The Strategy aims to:
• Provide coordination and oversight of federal efforts to combat OCSE;
• Support law enforcement capacity to combat OCSE;
• Enable the reporting of OCSE to proper authorities;
• Support victims of OCSE by facilitating the removal of imagery/videos;
• Facilitate research on OCSE to increase understanding of the scale/scope of the issue and inform
action;
• Increase public awareness and reduce the stigma associated with reporting; and
• Work with digital industry to find new ways of combating this crime.
Ongoing investments under the National Strategy total over $18 million per year. Some of PS and RCMP
funding was provided through the It’s Time: Canada’s Strategy to Prevent and Address Gender-Based
Violence (the GBV Strategy). Key initiatives under theNational Strategy are: contributing to increased
public awareness of this crime, supporting C3P’s operation ofCybertip.caand the development of
Project Arachnid, a web-crawling technology solution to identify and increase the rate of removal of
OCSE material. The National Strategy has also helped to expand the RCMP’s National Child Exploitation
Crime Centre’s investigative capacity.
Recent investments of $22.24 million over three years, starting in 2019–20, are supporting Public Safety
Canada’s enhancedefforts to raise awareness of this serious issue and reduce the stigma associated
with reporting, increasing Canada’s ability to pursue and prosecute offenders, and fostering work with
industry to find new ways to combat OCSE. Budget 2021 proposed to provide $20.7 million over five
years, starting in 2021-22, for the RCMP to enhance its ability to pursue OCSE investigations, identify
victims and remove them from abusive situations, and bring offenders to justice, including those who
offend abroad.
In 2019the Ministers of Canadian Heritage, Public Safety and Justice were mandated to take action on
combatting hate groups, online hate and harassment, ideologically-motivated violent extremism, and
terrorist organizations, and to ensure the RCMP and CSIS are equipped to combat this growing threat.
To that end, Heritage, PS and Justice developed a regulatory and legislative framework that addressed
five categories of online harms: 1) child sexual exploitation content, 2) terrorist content, 3) hate speech,
4) content that incites violence, and 5) the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. Key elements of
the proposed approach included: establishment of a regulator; requirement for social media platforms
to remove harmful content within 24 hours; mandatory reporting to law enforcement of certain illegal
content; mandatory evidence preservation for illegal and/or national security content falling within the
5 categories of harmful content; and the development of an incident response protocol to address viral
online events (e.g. livestreaming of a terrorist attack). For OCSE specifically, the proposal sought to
strengthen the Mandatory Reporting Act, including the requirement of basic subscriber information or
transmission data in reporting.
Public consultationsover the summer identified concerns from civil society, experts and industry on the
proposed approach. The Minister of Canadian Heritage’s mandate letter in December 2021 directed him
to continue efforts with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General ofCanada to develop and
introduce legislation to combat serious forms of harmful online content, while reflecting feedback
received during the consultations. In March 2022 the Ministers of Canadian Heritage and Justice
announced a new expert advisory groupon online safety, which is holding a series of workshops to
discuss a legislative and regulatory framework for online safety.
DENTAL CARE (177 words)
• While most Canadians have dental coverage through their employment health plans, we know
there are unmet dental care needs in Canada.
• Budget 2022 sets out the Government’s commitment to expanding dental care with funding of
$5.3 billion over five years, starting this fiscal year with $1.7 billion per year ongoing, to provide dental
care for Canadians.
• Children under 12 not covered under a private dental insurance and who are in families with net
incomes below $90,000 a year will be the first to have access to support for care, through an interim
Canada Dental Benefit starting in 2022.
• The Interim Canada Dental Benefit would provide direct payments to eligible applicants totalling
up to $650 per year per child for dental care services for applicants with a family net income under
$70,000, $390 for those with a family net income of $70,000 to$79,999, and $260 for those with a
family net income of $80,000 to $89,999.
• By putting this benefit in place, the federal government is taking an important first step towards
improving dental care for Canadians.
BACKGROUND
The Liberal Party of Canada and NDP’s supply and confidence agreement committed to launching a
national dental care program. The agreement identified “launching a new dental care program for low-
income Canadians” as the first priority action under the health care stream of the agreement. The
program is restricted to families with an income of less than $90,000 annually, with no co-pays for
anyone earning under $70,000 annually.
This commitment to a national dental care program is reminiscent of the NDP’sMotion M-62: Federal
Dental Care Plan in 2021 and the NDP’s “denticare” platform commitment from the 2019 federal
election campaign.
The 2019 Speech from the Throne and the 2019 Minister of Health Mandate Letter committed the
Government to “work with Parliament to study and analyze the possibility of national dental care.” In
February 2020, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Health (HESA) agreed to undertake a
study on the development of a national dental care program, although the study did not begin before
Parliament was prorogued in August 2020 and HESA has not pursued the idea since.
Budget 2022
Budget 2022 proposes to provide funding of $5.3 billion over five years and $1.7 billion ongoing. The
$5.3 billion over 5 years is broken out as: $300 million in 2022-23, $600 million in 2023-24, $1.2 billion in
2024-25, $1.5 billion in 2025-26, and $1.7 billion in 2026-27.
Current Dental Care Programs in Canada
According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, $15.9 billion was spent on dental services in
2018: 55% was covered through private insurance; 39% was paid out-of-pocket; and 6% was publicly
funded. About two-thirds of Canadians receive dental coverage through employment-based private
health insurance plans.
Provinces and territories (PTs) provide emergency, in-hospital medically necessary surgical dental care
for all residents. Additional PT programs vary in eligibility and coverage, and are limited to select
services for groups such as those with low incomes, people with disabilities, children, and seniors.
Federal support for dental care includes:
• The federal government provides recognized First Nations and Inuit with dental coverage for
services not available under other programs. The Government also provides some dental services to
inmates in federal penitentiaries, and some veterans and refugee claimants.
• Federal public servants are provided with dental coverage through the Government of Canada’s
employee benefits program and dental services are provided to Canadian Armed Forces personnel.
• The Canada Health Transfer is providing $41.9 billion to the provinces and territories in 2020-21,
which is used to support health services (including PT dental programs if they choose).
• The federal government supports Canadians with private health insurance by not including the
value of these insurance plans in the taxable income of employees. In addition, the income tax system
provides assistance through the Medical Expenses Tax Credit, and through a refundable medical
expenses supplement available for working individuals with low-incomes and high medical expenses.
Comprehensive data does not exist on unmet dental care needs at a national level in Canada. A
campaign led by the Canadian Association of Public Health Dentistry suggests that 1 in 5 people (6
million Canadians) are not receiving needed dental care due to cost, and that only Canadians with
financial resources or insurance can experience good oral health.
According to the Canadian Dental Association, an estimated 2.26 million school days are missed each
year due to dental-related illness, and tooth decay accounts for one-third of all day surgeries performed
on children between the ages of one and five in Canada. As well, much of the burden of dental disease is
concentratedin disadvantaged children: those from low-income families; Indigenous children; new
immigrants; and children with special health care needs.
DISPARITIES IN RURAL HEALTH–CHILDREN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ASPECTS (113 words)
• TheGovernment of Canada recognizes that Canadians living in rural communities, including
children, have a harder time accessing timely high-quality family health services and mental health care
and that rural communities face unique challengesin delivering these services.
• We are committed to addressing these barriers and ensuring that children across Canada have
equitable access to care. To that end, we are making targeted investments to increase the number of
doctors and nurses in rural communities.
• These include increasing the maximum amount of Canada Student Loans for rurally-based
doctors and nurses by 50%, and investing $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of
those most affected by the pandemic, including youth.
IF PRESSED ONADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO ACCESS CARE IN RURAL AND REMOTE COMMUNITIES (169
words)
• Budget 2022 commits to provide $26.2 million over four years and $7 million ongoing to
increase the maximum amount of forgivable Canada Student Loans for doctors and nurses who work in
underserved rural and remote communities.
• This will mean up to $30,000 in loan forgiveness for nurses and up to $60,000 for doctors
working in underserved or remote communities.
• Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada has announced a $2.75 billion Universal
broadband fund to support high-speed internet projects in rural and remotecommunities throughout
Canada.
• Increased broadband access can have an incredibly positive impact in these parts of Canada,
particularly for Indigenous communities,
where digital health technologies that rely on stable internet connections, such as virtual care, can make
a significant difference in people’s lives.
• Going forward, the Government of Canada will continue to work with provinces and territories,
providing targeted support as they bolster their own family health services and mental health systems,
particularly those for children in rural communities, following the disruption caused by the COVID-19
pandemic.
IF PRESSED SPECIFICALLY ON MENTAL HEALTH (113 words)
• In response to the global public health challenge of COVID-19, in April 2020 the Government of
Canada launched an online mental health and substance use support portal,Wellness Together Canada.
• As a virtual tool, the portal provides access to all individuals living in Canadaregardless of their
location.
• Recognizing that many Canadians do not have reliable internet access, confidential chat sessions
with social workers, psychologists and other professionals can be accessed by phone and text, including
for children aged 5 and older
• The Government of Canada is also providing funding to Integrated Youth Services Networks (IYS-
Net), a pan-Canadian initiative that builds health implementation tools to improve the integration of
youth mental health services.
BACKGROUND
Family health services form the backbone of high-performing health care systems. They serve a dual
function in the health care system as the direct provision of first-contact services and a coordination
function to ensure continuity across health care settings. However, Canadians, including children,
continue to struggle to access family health services. In 2021, 14.5% of Canadians 12 years and over
lacked a regular health care provider. These disparities are felt more acutely by rural Canadians, with the
distribution of family physicians to rural communities decreasing over time (13.1% in 2016; 12.8% in
2020), while it increases slightly in urban environments (86.7% in 2016; 86.9% in 2020). Additionally,
Indigenous people living in both rural/remote and urban communities, on and off reserve, have been
shown to be less likely to be attached to a family health services provider. In Canada, Jordan’s Principle
commits that all First Nations children living in Canada should have access the services and supports
they need, including health services, when they need them.
Mental health issues can impact any population and children and youth are no exception. Infact, two
thirds or more of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25. It is estimated that mental
health issues affect over 800,000 Canadian children and youth annually. The COVID-19 pandemic has
had significant impacts of this population. Forexample, the percentage of Canadians aged 12-17 who
reported their mental health as “very good” or “excellent” decreased from 74.1% in 2018, to 61.2% in
September 2021/February 2022. Moreover, rural populations are in a particularly vulnerable position
due to the lack of availability and accessibility of mental health services and supports, and family health
services within their communities.
Health is a shared responsibility in Canada, with the federal government and the provinces and
territories havingdistinct roles. While primary responsibility for delivery of health care services to
Canadians falls within provincial and territorial jurisdiction, the federal government sets and administers
national standards for publicly insured health services throughthe Canada Health Act, and provides
funding support for provincial and territorial health care services through the Canada Health Transfer.
Therefore, the department continues to work closely with FPT partners to advance family health
services and mentalhealth priorities, with a particular focus on rural communities.
Health Canada has been collaborating with provinces, territories and other partners to identify ways in
which the family health service system could be strengthened to:
• Ensure every Canadian has timely access to a family doctor or family health team, and
• Leverage virtual care to support access to and delivery of high-quality health care, including
within the context of family health services.
Timely access to family health services forall Canadians, including children, is a Government of Canada
priority:
• The 2021 Liberal platform promised $3.2B to provinces and territories (PTs) for hiring 7,500 new
family doctors and nurse practitioners, and $400M for virtual care.
The fall2021 Mandate Letter to the Minister of Health included directives to:
• Support provinces and territories to hire new family doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners;
• Expand virtual care, helping to cover digital infrastructure and other system improvements so
that Canadians can access virtual medical consultations or remote monitoring;
• Expand the number of family doctors and family health services teams in rural communities and
work to give rural communities greater access to a full suite of health and social service professionals;
and
• Invest in the study of the long-term health impacts of COVID-19, including the effects of long
COVID on different groups, including children.
Budget 2021 announced $100 million over three years to promote the mental health of those most
affected by the pandemic, including youth. Funded projects are expected to begin in spring 2022 and to
reach diverse populations across Canada. Projects will support mental health promotion and mental
illness prevention interventions, in addition to initiatives that build the capacity of service providers to
deliver programming in safe, effective and trauma-informed ways.
Budget 2022 committed to strengthening the health care system and ensuring it delivers the care that
Canadians deserve by:
• Increasing the number of doctors and nurses; and,
• Building on the success of increased virtual care;
In March 2022, Minister Duclos outlined five pillars for health to address systemic challenges to
enhancing access to high-quality, integrated care. These include:
• Better access to family doctors and teams;
• Reducing backlogs and growing our health workforce;
• Using modern health data and digital health effectively;
• Improving mental health and substance use services; and,
• Helping Canadians age with dignity, closer to home.
HEALTH CARE BACKLOGS AND HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES CRISIS AFFECTING SERVICES FOR CHILDREN
(146 words)
• The Government of Canada recognizes the immense contributions healthprofessionals make
every day and we share their concerns about the health workforce crisis we are facing.
• That is why, in March 2022, the federal government announced an additional $2 billion to
provinces and territories through the Canada Health Transfer to help provinces and territories address
health service backlogs and health human resource challenges, over and above the $4 billion invested in

environment, free from violence and threats.
BACKGROUND
Canada’s health system is experiencing an unprecedented health workforce crisis. The COVID-19
pandemic has amplified many of the challenges facing the health workforce and it is well understood
that the path forward must address the root causes of this crisis. It will require transformative and
innovative solutions to problems that have existed for years, with new and different levels of
collaboration required across governments and stakeholders.
FPT Collaboration
While the federal government provides financial support to the provinces and territories for health
services, the responsibility for the management of health workforces falls within provincial and
territorial jurisdictions and their regulators. The federal government has had ongoing engagement with
provincial and territorial counterparts on the health workforce crisis.
• In February, FPT Ministers of Health issued a call to action focused on developing a pan-
Canadian plan to respond to the health workforce crisis. Following this discussion, FPT Deputy Ministers
of Health identified four key pillars of a pan-Canadian actionplan:
o Recruit: increase supply of healthcare professionals, including ethical international recruitment,
streamlining pathways to licensure and increasing training;
o Retain: Reduce rates of stress and burnout and improve workplace culture, flexibility, labour
mobility and wellness so healthcare workers stay in their jobs;
o Plan: Collect the right data to support long-term workforce planning and the ability to identify
potential gaps before they become a crisis; and,
o Innovate: Make the healthcare system work smarter by leveraging digital systems and health
data, as well as opportunities to scale effective models of care.
• Health Canada is working closely with ESDC and PT partners through the FPT Committee on
Health Workforce to share best practicesand identify opportunities to leverage programs to scale and
spread promising practices across the country.
Recent Federal Investments
Budget 2021 provided a one-time payment of $4 billion through the Canada Health Transfer, distributed
equally per capita, to help provinces and territories address immediate health care system pressures.
Budget 2021 also provided $45 million over two years to develop national standards for mental health
and substance use services, which will provide tools to support mental health providers in delivering
high-quality care.
Budget 2022 announced a $2 billion one-time top-up to the Canada Health Transfer to support
provinces and territories in reducing medical backlogs caused by COVID-19
Budget 2022 reiterated federal government’s commitment to reduce barriers to internal trade and
labour mobility through targeted investments, including:
• $115M over 5 years to expand the Foreign Credential Recognition Program and help up to
11,000 internationally trained health care professionals per year get their credentials recognized and
find work in their field
• $26.2 million to enhance student loan forgiveness for providers who practice in rural and
remote communities and expand the program beyond physicians and nurses
The Government of Canada continues to provide surge support, including nurses and physicians, where
needed across the country to address critical pandemic needs.
Other Federal Government Actions
The federal response to the HHR crisis is focused on sustainably increasing the supply of health workers
and helping create healthier workplaces to support retention and the mental health of health workers.
Other recent federal actions and investments include:
• On November 1, 2022, the Government of Canada established a Coalition for Action for Health
Workers. The Coalition will focus its efforts on identifying approaches to drive pan-Canadian action and
progress on policy implementation, informed by real world perspectives.
• The Coalition comprised of representatives from keygroups, including nurses, doctors, personal
support workers, colleges and universities, patients, and equity-seeking communities will report to the
Deputy Minister of Health.
• On August 24, 2022, Health Canada announced Dr. Leigh Chapman as the federal Chief Nursing
Officer (CNO). Dr. Chapman will bring nursing issues in focus federally, while working closely with
provinces and territories, stakeholders and regulatory bodies.
• Health Canada recently (summer 2022) created an HHR Taskforce focused on developing a pan-
Canadian collaborative approach to the HHR crisis. The taskforce is working to engage with PTs and key
stakeholders around four main pillars/priorities; recruitment, retention, planning and innovation.
• In an effort to address supply shortages in rural communities where staffing challenges exist,
Budget 2022 announced $26.2 million in funding to increase the forgivable amount of student loans for
doctors and nurses who practice in rural and remote communities.
• Budget 2021 announced fundingfor Employment and Social Development Canada’s (ESDC)
Sectoral Workforce Solutions Program (SWSP), which aims to support key sectors of the economy,
including health, to implement solutions to address workforce needs, such as labour shortages.
Announcement of SWSP projects is expected in fall 2022.
Health Canada will continue to collaborate closely with other federal departments, provinces and
territories and health care system stakeholders to address these pressing health workforce challenges.
Mental Health
In September 2022, a Report from the Mental Health Commission noted that it remains critical to break
down cultural barriers and mental health stigma in health care organizations and prioritize psychological
health and safety beyond the pandemic.
The Government of Canada continues to make significant investments to help provincial and territorial
health systems address mental health issues and system capacity. This includes investments through
Budget 2017 that provided $5 billion over 10 years to improve Canadians’ access to mental health
services. The establishment of a Canada Mental Health Transfer will build on these agreements to
provide a permanent and ongoing source of funds for mental health services.
On June 28, 2022 the Government of Canada, announced an investment of $28.2M for nine projects to
address PTSD and trauma in frontline and essential workers, and others whose mental health has been
significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
• These projects will help to deliver and test interventions, develop resources for affected or at-
risk populations, and create resources and guidance for service providers and organizations.
• The investment will also facilitate a Knowledge Development and Exchange Hub, which will use
data from these projects to help inform mental health interventions and enhance Canadian public
health policy and practice.
PAN-CANADIAN HEALTH DATA STRATEGY (227 WORDS)
• A strong health data foundation, based on federal, provincial, territorial collaboration, is needed
to responsibly harness the power of health data to strengthen our public health responses, reduce
health inequities, and modernize our health system.
• Toachieve this, the Government of Canada is committed to working with the provinces and
territories to improve Canada’s collection, protection, access, sharing, and use of health data, and lay
the foundation for a world-class health data system.
• The Strategy co-development with provinces and territories was informed by expert advice, with
the desired end goal of making it more simple for Canadians to access and use their own data, helping
health providers deliver better quality care, and making it easierfor data to be used to support critical
decisions on improving health systems and public health.
• Reliable, timely, and relevant health data are crucial to inform decision-making during public
health events and drive progress in improving access to care.What is measured matters.
IF PRESSED ON THE NOVEMBER 8TH HEALTH MINISTERS MEETING (120 words)
• Our health system is experiencing significant challenges. It’s important that we work together to
support improved health data management to achieve better outcomes for Canadians, and to
strengthen public health responses.
• There are numerous barriers to achieving a much-needed world-class health data system that
can only be addressed through federal, provincial and territorial governments working together. For
example, when someone moves from one province or territory to another, they should be able to bring
their health data with them, so that their healthcare providers have the information they need to
provide the quality of care that everyone in Canada deserves.
• The Government of Canada intensively collaborated with provinces and territories to finalize the
draft Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy and identify common commitments and actions that can
advance the use of health data and digital health tools to meet Canadians’ needs.
• We are disappointed by the outcome of the meeting and the statement made by provincial and
territorial Premiers. However, our government remains ready to work with provincial and territorial
governments to further discuss healthpriorities, actions and measureable results to improve our health
system using health data more effectively.
IF PRESSED ON LINKS TO HEALTH PRIORITIES AND HEALTH DATA
• The five priorities announced by the Minister of Health in March 2022 included using modern
health data and digital health more effectively in Canada. Health data was reiterated as a priority at the
November 2022 FPT Health Ministers Meeting.
• Our Government is committed to advancing health priorities, actions and measurable resultsto
improve public health responses and health services for all Canadians.
• Reliable, timely and relevant health data are key to addressing significant issues for public
health, including workforce capacity, mental health, and health equity.
• Our Government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to overcome
health data management barriers that slow progress on these priorities, and to improve long-term
health benefits for people in Canada.
IF PRESSED ON THE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT (50 words)
• Canadians should have a say in how their health data is used, so consultation and engagement
are key for this work.
• Our Government has and will continue to engage with Canadians’ to solicit their views on how
health data can serve them better, both during and between public health events.
IF PRESSED ON RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FINAL REPORT OF THE EXPERT ADVISORY GROUP (56
words)
• In its final report, the EAG recommended governments work together to expedite the creation
of a person-centred, world-class health data system.
• The advice contained in the latest report of the EAG has been considered by the Government of
Canada, provinces and territories and our health data partners throughout the co-development of the
Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy.
IF PRESSED ON PRIVACY (76 words)
• Our Government knows that Canadians value the privacy of their health information and want it
to be appropriately safeguarded.
• Canadians also expect that their data be used to inform public health measures, stimulate
research on new treatments, and improve our health care systems.
• Our Government’s approach to strengthening health data collection, access, sharing and use
recognizes Canadians’ rights to have their personal information protected while benefiting from the
insights that can be generated by sharing it.
IF PRESSED ON BUDGET 2022 COMMITMENTS (121 words)
• Our government recognizes how important it is to be able to effectively anticipate and respond
to public health risks that threaten the health and safetyof Canadians. It is crucial to take immediate
steps to improve our surveillance and data capabilities so we are better able to detect and respond to
public health events and emergencies in the future.
• That is why the federal government has committed to supporting the Public Health Agency of
Canada to strengthen key surveillance and risk assessment capacities.
• In addition, the federal government has committed to work with provinces and territories to
ensure that the health care system is underpinned by health data that supports system improvements
and Canadians’ access to their own personal health records.
BACKGROUND
On November 8, 2022, federal, provincial, and territorial Health Ministers met to discuss the draft co-
developed Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy. The provinces and territories were unwilling to endorse
the Strategy, pending further discussions on health transfers to the provinces and territories to support
priority work.
There are persistent and important gaps in data collection, protection, access, sharing and use that cost
lives and negatively impact personal, health professional and system-wide health decision-making.
These gaps impair public health responses, reducehealth outcomes for Canadians, and contribute to
health inequities.
The pandemic revealed the critical importance of timely health data. Public health decision-making is
impeded when health data are uncoordinated, contain incomplete information, and are not linked
across various points of care and across jurisdictions. Ultimately, this negatively impacts the health
outcomes of Canadians.
The draft co-developed Strategy did not envision or create a single large technology system. Rather, it
would have facilitated the creation of a new enabling environment where collaborative work in common
areas would support the creation of a world-class health data system, enabling Canadians to harness
health data to achieve better health outcomes.
Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy
Health data (which encompasses public health, health system and population health data) are collected
by numerous organizations and governments. However, as SARS and COVID-19 have demonstrated,
there are persistent and important gaps in data collection, access, sharing and use that cost lives and
negatively impact personal, health professional and system-wide health decision-making. Overall, these
impacts reduce health outcomes for Canadians.
In December 2020, the Government of Canada, in collaboration with provinces and territories, began
developing a Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy. In the May 2021 Office of the Auditor General report it
was recommended that Canada create a Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy (PCHDS) to address
foundational issues related to health data in Canada. The November 2021 Speech from the Throne
underlined the importance of improving data collection across health systems to inform future decisions
and ensure the best possible health results for Canadians. In the December 2021 Office of the Chief
Public Health Officer report, A Vision to Transform Canada’s Public Health System, it was recommended
that Canada create a world-class public health system and noted that the PCHDS is an actionable idea to
improve public healthtools. The December 2021 Mandate Letter for the Minister of Health
acknowledged the need for a health data system that is timely, usable, open-by-default, connected, and
comprehensive. Most recently, the Minister of Health was tasked through the mandate letter and the
Federal Budget 2022 to establish the foundation of a world-class health data system so that all
Canadians have meaningful, timely access to their own health information.
The goal of the Strategy was to identify commonly-supported, implementable solutions to address
persistent barriers to the use of critical health data. Once identified, and when supported by provinces
and territories, Canadians would be better served by their own health data, accelerating the
transformation towards person-centred health care systems and strengthening public health decision-
making during and between health emergencies.
At the November 8, 2022 FPT Health Ministers Meeting, the Federal and PT Ministers of Health were
unwilling to endorse the Strategy. The Federal Minister of Health reiterated the Government of
Canada’s commitment to improve health services for all Canadians, including using health data and
digital health more effectively.
Pan-Canadian Health Data Strategy Engagement
Canadians should have a sayon how their health data is used, therefore engagement is key for this
work. The Government of Canada has engaged with experts and patient advisors during the
development of the Strategy. Informed stakeholder consultations started in summer 2021 and
continued into fall 2021. Engagement sessions focused on overcoming the identified root causes
impeding the better use of data. We will continue to ask Canadians for their feedback as we implement
the Strategy across the country.
The Government of Canada willalso continue to work with First Nations, Inuit and Métis partners, as
well as provinces and territories, to support Indigenous data sovereignty by building connections
between national and regional Indigenous health data governance and the Strategy.
Expert Advisory Group
A PCHDS Expert Advisory Group (EAG) was established in fall 2020 to provide advice and guidance to
inform F/P/T co-development work. Specifically, the EAG was mandated to provide advice on:
• strategic direction for the use of health systems, population, and public health data to improve
the health of Canadians;
• principles to guide the creation, collection, storage, and use of data; and
• a practical and phased roadmap for the implementation of measures to sustainably address
areas of greatest opportunity and impact.
The EAG published two reports in 2021. The first report described the systemic barriers to effective
health data management while the second report contained recommendations on how to overcome
these barriers tooptimize the use of data for better health outcomes and more effective public health
event management.
The EAG published their third, and final report on May 3, 2022. In the report, the EAG recommends
adopting a person-centric approach to health data that gives patients, and their health care providers,
access to health information in an integrated system–leading to better comprehensive care and an
integrated health data system that supports robust public health responses. These recommendations
are reflected in the draft PCHDS co-developed with provinces and territories. The EAG’s work has now
been completed.
Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) Health Data Investments
PHAC is working directly with ISC to find alignment and synergies with Indigenous healthdata initiatives
announced in Budget 2021. Access to reliable and culturally relevant data on Indigenous peoples is
critical to building a complete portrait of Indigenous lived experiences, unmasking inequalities, and
ensuring delivery of effective policies and programs. Engagement will enable alignment with Indigenous-
led data strategies, which can further self-determination by providing First Nations, Inuit, and Métis
Nation governments and organizations with the data they need to support their communities.
NATIONAL WOMEN’S HEALTH RESEARCH INITIATIVE (128 words)
• Mr. Speaker, women face unique challenges that need to be specifically researched in order to
improve their health outcomes.
• This includes cervical and ovarian cancer, sexualand reproductive health, gender-based
violence, and health during pregnancy to name a few.
• The National Women’s Health Research Initiative, launched by our Government in October
2022, will advance a coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-priority
areas of women’s health and ensure new evidence improves women’s care and health outcomes.
• This dedicated investment will drive research to enhance health outcomes, eliminate gaps in
access to care, and improve the quality of care for women, trans women, girls, and gender-diverse
communities, as well as ensure that everyone has access to evidence-based, gender-sensitive, culturally
safe, and high-quality care and services across their lifespan.
BACKGROUND
On October 25, 2022, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Youth
officially launched the National Women’s Health Research Initiative (NWHRI), which is supported by an
investment of $20 million over five years provided inBudget 2021.
The NWHRI will advance a coordinated research program that addresses under-researched and high-
priority areas of women’s health and will ensure new evidence improves women’s and gender-diverse
people’s care and health outcomes. It will alsopromote an intersectional lens to research and care to
tackle persistent gaps for all women, including for Indigenous, Black, and racialized women, women with
disabilities, and members of Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual
(2SLGBTQIA) communities. The Initiative will transform women’s health research and practice in Canada
by producing and implementing a community-based approach, committed to the principles of equity,
diversity, inclusivity, and Indigenous Rights.
The NWHRI will consist of two funding streams: (1) the Pan-Canadian Women’s Health Coalition and (2)
the Innovation Fund.
1) The Coalition will be composed of hubs across Canada linked through a coordinating centre that
will work together to maximize thevisibility and impact of women’s health research and practice in
Canada. The hubs and the coordinating centre will be led by diverse teams consisting of Canadian non-
governmental organizations (including community organizations and regional health authorities),
healthcare professionals, early career researchers and trainees, Indigenous Peoples, and people with
lived and living experience navigating women’s health. Together, they will mobilize new and existing
knowledge into effective, gender-sensitive, andculturally appropriate women’s health services across
Canada. The funding opportunity to identify the 10 hubs was launched by CIHR on October 7, 2022;
results of this funding opportunity are expected in July 2023.
1) The innovation fund is the second funding stream under the NWHRI. Two funding opportunities
will be launched through the Innovation Fund:
i. Proof of Principle Grants to support biomedical research by teams proposing bold and
innovative research questions in women’s health.
ii. Operating Grants to support the following areas of women’s health: Translational research in
healthcare diagnostics, therapeutics, and devices; and Healthcare implementation research to remove
barriers to access to healthcare
All funded research projects will be required to link with the Coalition to identify emerging knowledge
mobilization opportunities to support improvements in women’s health policy, practice, and services.
Research on women’s health funded through the NWHRI will build on the investments and expertise
that are already being supported by CIHR and its Institute of Gender and Health. This includes research
in areas such as cervical cancer, gender-based violence, ovarian cancer, women’s heart health, and
women’s brain health. It also includes initiativesto build capacity among women’s health researchers
(e.g. the Indigenous Gender and Wellness Initiative, the Women’s Health Clinical Mentorship Grant), and
to foster the integration of sex and gender within the broader health research ecosystem and deepen
our understanding of how biological and social influences interact to affect health and disease (e.g. the
Sex-and Gender-Based Analysis Policy-Research Partnerships, Sex and Gender Science Chairs).
