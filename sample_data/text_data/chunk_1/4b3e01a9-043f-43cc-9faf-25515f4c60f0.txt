The CPSP is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA) and its regulations, as well as cosmetic-related provisions of the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) and the Cosmetic Regulations. The purpose of the CCPSA is to protect the public by addressing or preventing dangers to human health or safety that are posed by consumer products in Canada, including those that circulate within Canada as well as those that are imported. Similarly, the purpose of the Cosmetic Regulations and the associated portions of the FDA are to protect people in Canada from risks that may be posed by cosmetics. Within Health Canada, the CPSP promotes, monitors, verifies, and enforces compliance with the CCPSA and the FDA. It reviews incident reportsFootnote 1 submitted by industryFootnote 2 and consumers and regularly monitors the marketplace to identify potentially dangerous products. The CPSP also gathers information domestically and internationally about injuries, emerging issues and new science related to consumer product and cosmetic safety. This information is then used to help conduct routine sampling and testing of products in the marketplace and support partnerships with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and other domestic and international regulators to verify the compliance of products being imported into Canada. The CPSP also uses this information to evaluate risks to people in Canada posed by consumer products and cosmetics. For example, it conducts assessments to understand and highlight the relative level of risk posed by a consumer product or cosmetic. This allows for the strategic assignment of program resources towards products that pose the greatest risk to people in Canada. When reviewing incoming incident reports, the CPSP uses a triage-based approach to identify product-related health and safety concerns for follow-up risk assessment and possible compliance and enforcement activity. It carefully monitors issues that do not require immediate attention so that it is prepared to take action if the risk changes over time. Finally, the CPSP provides credible information to consumers and provides tools to help guide informed decision-making by the public. This is the sixth publicly available Annual Surveillance Report. This report presents a summary of all product incident data reported to the CPSP between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, that meet either of the below definitions: A consumer product is a product, including its components, parts or accessories, that may reasonably be expected to be obtained by an individual to be used for non-commercial purposes, including for domestic, recreational and sports purposes, and includes its packaging (Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, Section 2); and A cosmetic includes any substance or mixture of substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in cleansing, improving, or altering the complexion, skin, hair, or teeth, and includes deodorants and perfumes (Food and Drugs Act, Section 2). All of the reported incidents include products that are sold within the Canadian marketplace, whether the incidents occurred domestically (71%) or internationally (29%)Footnote 3. The data has been divided by incidents pertaining to consumer products and cosmetics. Under the CCPSA, industry must report health or safety incidents involving consumer products to Health Canada. This mandatory reporting provides Health Canada with a broad understanding of health- or safety-related incidents that occur with consumer products. There are no mandatory incident reporting requirements for cosmetics under the FDA. Finally, each subdivided section provides a table to illustrate the top 10 products reported overall as well as those associated with incident reports of injuries and deaths, with information concerning the hazards and injuries mentioned in the incident report for those products. All of the injuries reported are grouped into different levels of severity (unknown, minor, or life threatening for example). These levels correspond to the overall risk that was reported and relies on factors such as: whether medical treatment was sought, whether the injury described was sustained by a priority population (for example young children) and whether that injury was reversible. The categorization of consumer products was carried out using the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) coding manual. The categorization of cosmetic products was based on the function of the product using CPSP's Notification of Cosmetics guidelines. The information in this Annual Surveillance Report reflects the information provided in the incident reports submitted to the CPSP by industry and consumers (including media articles, governmental organizations, fire services, police, coroners, etc.); it does not capture all incidents in Canada. Reports submitted to the CPSP express opinions or observations of the individuals who wrote them and may not always identify a health or safety concern with a particular product or include a thorough description of the incident. CPSP acknowledges that a given event may be due to an underlying condition, product misuse or coincidental factors. The CPSP takes a risk-based approach and does not validate the claims of every report received. The CPSP reviews reports on an ongoing basis thus the statistics in this Annual Surveillance Report should be considered dynamic and subject to change. Consumer products Total reports received in 2022 from consumers and industry 2,280 consumer product reports were received between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022, of which 24 mentioned a death and 743 mentioned a non-fatal injury. Figure 1. Number of consumer product reports received in 2022 from consumers and industry Figure 1: Text Description Month reports received Number of Incident Reports Received Incident reported by consumer Incident reported by industry Grand total January 81 100 181 February 56 124 180 March 98 205 303 April 63 69 132 May 89 157 246 June 71 108 179 July 71 79 150 August 95 66 161 September 99 110 209 October 69 102 171 November 87 102 189 December 107 72 179 Grand total 986 1294 2280 In 2022, the CPSP had an average of 190 reports received per month. There was a 27% decrease in the number of industry reports received compared to 2021, and an overall decrease of 18% in the total number of consumer product and cosmetic reports received by the CPSP in 2022. March and May saw the largest increase in industry reports, which can be explained by batch reporting of the following product types: Beds or bedframes, and Convertible beds, hideaway beds or sofa beds. Batch reporting is when industry submits multiple reports pertaining to one product type at a single time. These multiple reports may or may not be related and may have occurred in previous years. Top 10 consumer products reported The CPSP received a total of 2,280 consumer product incident reports in 2022, covering 295 different product types. Eighty-three percent (83%) of these product types had only 10 or less incident reports submitted per product type, accounting for 29% of the total number of cases received. By comparison, the 10 most reported product types accounted for 36% of all reports received. Figure 2.

Conclusion Within the 2022 calendar year, the CPSP received a total of 2,711 consumer product and cosmetic reports (2,280 and 431, respectively) from industry and consumers. This is a drop of 6% for all reports compared to 2021, but an increase of 9% from pre-pandemic values. There was a 25% increase in the number of consumer reports received, but a decrease of 26% in the number of reports received from industry compared to 2021. The 10 most reported consumer product types account for 36% of the total number of incident reports received by the CPSP in 2022. The top reported consumer product type in 2022 was 'Electric ranges or ovens', with 132 reports received, one third of which mentioned an injury. There was an extremely large increase in the number of reports for "Window shades, venetian blinds or indoor shutters", after receiving few reports in the last few years. This may be due to the amendment of the Corded Window Coverings Regulations, which came into force in May 2021. "Convertible beds, hideaway beds or sofa beds" and "Barstools or kitchen stools" were new to the top 10 reported consumer products, both due to batch reporting by industry. Finally, the CPSP saw a 233% increase in the number of reports received for cosmetic products (or about 3.5 times the number of reports) compared to 2021. This was largely due to a very large number of reports received pertaining to dry shampoo and nail gels. There was a recall for one of these product types which resulted in a number of reports being submitted.
