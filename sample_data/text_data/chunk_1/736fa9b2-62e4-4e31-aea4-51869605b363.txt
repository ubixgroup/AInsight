1.0 About the Survey
1.1 Background
In November 2019, the first cycle of the Canadian Postsecondary Education Alcohol and Drug Use Survey
(CPADS) was launched. This national online survey measured the prevalence of alcohol and drug use
among undergraduate students 17 to 25 years of age, who were attending, in-person, a university,
college, or cégep in Canada.
For CPADS 2021-2022, the target population was expanded to students 16 years and older attending any
postsecondary program in person and/or online.
The CPADS is conducted in collaboration with the Postsecondary Education Partnership-Alcohol Harms,
a network of universities and colleges from across Canada that have partnered with the Canadian Centre
on Substance Use and Addiction to support campus efforts to reduce the harms related to alcohol
consumption1. PLEASE NOTE: For technical questions on using the CPADS PUMF, please email odss-

1.2 Survey Design
Colleges, cégeps, and universities across Canada were asked to participate in CPADS. Of 196 schools
across the 10 provinces, 45 (23%) accepted to participate in the 2021-2022 cycle. Some schools chose

not to participate, while others were not eligible to participate because they did not meet the eligibility
criteria. These included:
• having a registrar office;
• having more than 500 students;
• being a not-for-profit public or private school;
• not offering online courses exclusively; and
• not being a theological or military institution.
Participating schools were given instructions for selecting samples of students for the survey. In schools
with fewer than 600 students, all students were to be selected. Schools could use one of three methods
to obtain student participation. Schools with approval to share student e-mail addresses with the survey
firm (Advanis) could select a sample of students and pass their email to the survey firm. Schools without
approval to share student e-mail addresses could select a sample of students and directly e-mail them a
link to the survey. Schools unable to extract a random sample of student e-mail addresses would send
out a generic survey link to all students on their contact list.
A total of 40,931 respondents of all ages and programs completed the survey online between November
29, 2021 and April 19, 2022.
1.3 Survey Errors
Estimates derived from this survey are based on responses from students attending schools that agreed
to participate, and are subject to survey errors. Survey errors can be defined as differences between
survey results and results that would be obtained if a complete census of students in Canada had been
conducted, using the same questionnaire and under ideal conditions. Errors can be introduced at almost
every phase of a survey. In the case of CPADS, the set of schools that accepted to participate in the
survey may have different student characteristics from schools in the general population; school
administrators may misunderstand instructions for administering the survey; students may refuse to
participate in the survey, be unable or unwilling to answer questions, or make errors in answering
questions; the answers may be incorrectly entered on the questionnaire; and errors may be introduced
in the processing and tabulation of the data, including processing related to protecting data
confidentiality.
Over a large number of observations, randomly occurring errors will have little effect on estimates
derived from the survey. However, errors occurring systematically will contribute to biases in the survey
estimates. Considerable time and effort were dedicated to reducing survey errors. Quality assurance
measures were implemented at each step of the data collection and processing cycle to monitor data
quality. These measures included:
1. providing detailed instructions for administrators and participating students;
2. conducting extensive training of project staff regarding survey procedures;
3. implementing procedures to minimize data capture errors;
4. conducting coding and editing quality checks to verify the processing logic; and
5. adjusting survey weights for total (survey) nonresponse.
1.4 Survey Weights
The CPADS survey weights were generated to adjust for sample representativity issues caused by total
nonresponse and to adjust for sample variations across the 4 regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario,
Western Provinces). Weight creation followed three objectives: to adjust for response rate disparities
2
within schools, to make each region’s contribution proportional to its share of the total student
population, and to have the sample weights add up to the total sample size.
For the first objective, each participating school provided information on their total student enrolment
by age and sex. For schools that were not able to provide this information, estimates were obtained
from Statistics Canada’s Postsecondary Student Information System. The base weight, for a given school,
sex, and age group, was the ratio of the percentage of the school’s student population in that sex and
age group divided by the percentage of the school’s sample in that sex and age group. For example, if in
a given school, 16% of students were females aged 17-19, but 20% of the sample was from that group,
then the base weight for female students aged 17-19 in that school was 0.8. Since response rates among
female students were generally higher than those among male students, female student weights tended
to be lower than male student weights. The base weight was the same for every student in the same
school, sex, and age group; and base weight added up to the school sample size.
Following this first step, the weights in each region added up to the sample size for that region. To attain
the second and third objectives, base weights were adjusted by the ratio of the region’s share of the
national student population divided by the region’s share of the national sample. For example, since
Atlantic Provinces had 5.8% of the student population but 24.5% of the sample, base weights in Atlantic
Canada were multiplied by 5.8/24.5. This step, which generated the CPADS survey weights, took care of
the third objective, making the weights add up to the total sample size (40,931).
Making survey weights sum up to the sample size (so the average weight equals one) turns them into
what is called standardized weights. For many analysis techniques (e.g., linear regression, logistic
regression, estimation of rates and proportions and analysis of variance), standardized weights can
make the variances calculated by the standard packages more meaningful. If the weights for the data, or
for the subset of the data that is of interest, are rescaled so that the average weight is one (1), then the
variances produced by the standard packages will be more reasonable; they still will not take into
account all aspects of the sample's design, but they will take into account the unequal probabilities of
selection and/or response rates. (Note that for analyses done entirely within one region, it may be
preferable to standardize the weights at that regional level, i.e., to prorate weights so that they add up
to the total sample size for that region.)
Since the CPADS weights are the same for all the students in the same school, sex and age group, they
can be used to cluster students by school. As this presented a potential confidentiality issue, unbiased
random noise was added to each student’s weight on the PUMF. This step means that students in the
same group do not share the same PUMF weight, and the ranges of PUMF weights for students from
different schools often overlap. The addition of random noise, and other confidentiality measures
(regroup or suppressions), means that PUMF summary statistics may be slightly different than what is
posted on Health Canada’s website for CPADS 2021-2022 analysis.
2.0 Guidelines for Tabulation, Analysis, and Release of CPADS Data
This section details guidelines for users when tabulating, analyzing, and publishing or otherwise
releasing any data derived from the CPADS 2021- 2022 Public Use Microdata File (PUMF). With the aid
of these guidelines, PUMF users will be able to generate results that are consistent with those of other
users and, at the same time, will be able to develop currently unpublished figures in a manner
consistent with these established guidelines.

2.1 Use of Survey Weights
Users of the PUMF file are advised to apply the provided PUMF survey weights in their analyses to make
their results more aligned with those released by Health Canada. If survey weights are not used, the
estimates derived from the PUMF will not be considered representative of the national postsecondary
student population (as noted, response rates were higher for female students than male students) and
will not correspond to estimates produced by Health Canada. Unweighted estimates may also produce
biased results, leading to erroneous conclusions and misinterpretation of the data.
2.2 Rounding Guide
Rounding is a technique that helps protect privacy (i.e., disclosure avoidance) and prevents estimates
from seeming more exact than they really are (i.e., minimizes perceptions of exaggerated precision).
Users are encouraged to adhere to the following guidelines for rounding estimates:
1. Estimates in the main body of a statistical table are to be rounded to the nearest hundred units
using the normal rounding technique. In normal rounding, if the first or only digit to be dropped
is 0 to 4, the last digit to be retained is not changed. If the first or only digit to be dropped is 5 to
9, the last digit to be retained is raised by 1. For example, in normal rounding to the nearest 100,
if the last two digits are between 00 and 49, they are changed to 00 and the preceding digit (the
hundreds digit) is left unchanged. If the last digits are between 50 and 99, they are changed to
00 and the preceding digit is incremented by 1.
2. Marginal sub-totals and totals in statistical tables are to be derived from their corresponding un-
rounded components and then are to be rounded themselves to the nearest 100 units using
normal rounding.
3. Averages, proportions, rates and percentages are to be computed from un-rounded
components (i.e., numerators and denominators) and then are to be rounded to one decimal
using normal rounding.
4. Sums and differences of aggregates (or ratios) are to be derived from their corresponding un-
rounded components and then are to be rounded themselves to the nearest 100 units (or the
nearest one decimal) using normal rounding.
Note that under no circumstances are unrounded estimates to be published or otherwise released by
users. Unrounded estimates imply greater precision than actually exists.
2.3 Release Guidelines
Before releasing or publishing any estimate from the CPADS 2021-2022, users should determine its
quality level. Quality is affected by the number of observations used to create the estimate and the
sampling error, as reflected by the coefficient of variation (CV). The CV is a relative measure of the
standard error as a proportion of the estimate.
Users should first ensure that there are enough observations (using the unweighted counts) to produce
a reliable estimate. It is recommended to have at least 10 observations with the characteristic of
4
interest and, if a proportion is being calculated, at least 50 in the domain (i.e., denominator).
Otherwise, the estimate should be considered to be of unacceptable quality and should not be released.
Next, given enough observations, users should calculate the CV of the estimate to assess its reliability.
Estimates should then be vetted and assigned a quality level using the guidelines in Table 1.
Unacceptable quality level estimates should not be released, and marginal level estimates should only
be released with a warning to caution subsequent users.
Table 1: Quality Level Guidelines for Weighted Estimates
Quality level Guidelines Action
n ≥ 10
Acceptable and d ≥ 50 (if applicable) No warning is required.
and CV ≤ 16.6%
n ≥ 10 Users should flag these estimates with the letter M (or some
Marginal and d ≥ 50 (if applicable) similar identifier), accompanied by a warning about their high
and 16.6% < CV ≤ 33.3% sampling variability.
Users should not release these estimates. Instead, users should
n < 10
replace them with the letter U (or some similar identifier),
Unacceptable or d < 50 (if applicable)
accompanied by the following: "This estimate is unreleasable
or CV > 33.3%
due to small sample size or high sampling variability.”
Notes. For estimated proportions, n is defined as the unweighted number of observations with the
characteristic of interest (i.e., numerator) and d is defined as the unweighted number of observations in the
domain (i.e., denominator). For estimated totals and means, n is defined as the unweighted number of
observations that contribute to the estimate (i.e., non-missing); d is not applicable. For estimated differences
(such as between variables, groups, time periods, or datasets), users must first vet both associated estimates
using the above rules and then assign the lowest quality level of the two to the estimated difference.
Note that CPADS relies on the participation of schools and students, and as such, may not be as
representative of the postsecondary student population as a pure random sample of schools benefitting
from low student nonresponse rates. While the sample size is large enough to draw inferences about
the general population of 1.3 million students, it is advisable not to make unqualified assertions about
the Canadian population from the survey. Published results should be qualified by a statement to the
effect that the sample relied on the participation of postsecondary institutions and students and may be
affected by nonresponse bias, which occurs when the responding population does not exhibit the same
characteristics as the nonresponding population. The effect of nonresponse bias may be stronger when
analyzing specific sub-populations.

(R) Estimated Blood Alcohol
Concentration on heaviest
drinking day in past month,
grams/deciliters
ebac_tot Numeric values
Derived variable:
ALC06=1,2,3,4,5 (Past 30 day
drinker)
NOTE: Respondents’ Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) on their heaviest drinking day in the past 30 days.
Students who reported zero drinks on their heaviest drinking day were excluded from analysis, as were
students with a BAC level of 0.5g/dL (500mg/dl) or higher since this level is presumed to result in death.
The calculation of blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) for the heaviest drinking day is calculated using a
formula developed by Seidl et. al (Reference: Seidl, Stephan & Jensen, Uwe & Alt, Andreas. (2000). The
calculation of blood ethanol concentrations in males and females. International journal of legal medicine.
114. 71-7. 10.1007/s004140000154. ).

The basic equation is: eBAC = A / (r * W) – (Beta * t)
CALCULATION NOTES:
1. A is grams of alcohol
Calculated using variable alc13a (highest number of drinks on heaviest drinking day in past 30
days) and assumes that one standard drink is 13.6 grams of alcohol. Therefore, ”A” is calculated as 13.6g X
number of drinks identified in alc13a to obtain the volume of alcohol in grams.
2. ‘r” is the distribution factor and corrects for reduced body mass and the corresponding ratio of
total body water and blood water content. The “r” value differs by sex, as follows:
r (females)= 0.31223 - 0.006446 x body weight (kg) + 0.004466 x body height (cm)
r (males)= 0.31608 - 0.004821 x body weight (kg) + 0.004632 x body height (cm)
3. W is body weight in kg is calculated using variable demq4
4. Body height in cm is calculated using variable demq3
5. B (Beta) is the elimination rate which is 0.017
6. Time is elapsed time from first drink in hours
These two variables are used to calculate the number of hours to consume the highest number
of drinks on heaviest drinking day.
alc13b_a (Time to consume heaviest number of drinks on heaviest drinking day in hours)
alc13b_b (Time to consume heaviest number of drinks on heaviest drinking day in minutes)
Time in hours: [(alc13b_a x 60) + alc13b_b] /60
Based on the above calculation notes, the specific equations to calculate BAC by sex are as follows:
*The specific equation for females is:
eBAC (g/dl) = [(grams of alcohol) / ((0.31223 - (0.006446 x body weight in kg) + (0.004466 x body
height in cm)) x (body weight in kg)) – (.017 g/dl/hr x elapsed time from first drink)] / 10
*The specific equation for males is:
eBAC (g/dl) = [(grams of alcohol) / ((0.31608 - (0.004821 x body weight in kg) + (0.004632 x body
height in cm)) x (body weight in kg)) – (.017 g/dl/hr x elapsed time from first drink)] / 10
