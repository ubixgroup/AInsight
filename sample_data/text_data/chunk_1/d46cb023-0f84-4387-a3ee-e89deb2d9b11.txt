Health product risk communication (HPRC): An HPRC is a type of risk communication designed by Health Canada to help MAHs communicate new and clinically significant health-related risk information associated with marketed health products. HPRCs are targeted to health care professionals but generally include a section for public audiences. Lead directorate: The lead directorate within Health Canada is responsible for identifying and assessing risk issues, as well as assessing the need for an HPRC.

Once these risks are assessed, they are communicated openly and transparently to help Canadians make informed decisions. MHPD also leads the development of regulations for reporting adverse reactions and works closely with international organizations in the harmonization of regulatory systems to facilitate the sharing of information. Risk Communication Section (RCS): The section of the Marketed Health Products Directorate, HPFB, is the central body responsible for coordinating and supporting the development and dissemination of HPRCs.
