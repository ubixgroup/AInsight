UN #: Not Available Pictogram(s): Figure 1. Figure 1 - Text description The symbol within the pictogram is an exclamation mark. This symbol indicates that hazardous products with this pictogram can cause certain health effects, for example: skin irritation eye irritation skin sensitization WHMIS classification Health hazards: Acute Toxicity (Oral) - Category 4 Eye Irritation - Category 2A Physical hazards: MDEA does not meet the criteria for classification. Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Category 4 Median lethal dose (LD50): 1,945 mg/kg (rat)Footnote 1. The available data meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral) - Category 4 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50: 6,230 mg/kg (rabbit) Footnote 2. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Gases): Not applicable MDEA is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Vapours): Does not meet criteria Exposure to the saturated vapour concentration of MDEA for 6 hours did not produce any mortalities or significant signs of toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Vapours). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Does not meet criteria A volume of 0.5 mL undiluted MDEA was applied to the shaven dorsal trunk skin of New Zealand White rabbits and held in contact for 4 hours by an occlusive dressing Footnote 1. The contact site was inspected for local signs of injury and inflammation after removal of the occlusive dressing. Erythema and edema were scored based upon the 5-point Draize system. The results showed that MDEA produced very mild effects, the mean 24-, 48- and 72-hour score across all animals for erythema being 0.2/4 and for edema 0.2/4. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Corrosion / Irritation. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Category 2A MDEA was shown to be an eye irritant after 4/10 rabbits sustained eye injury post exposure in a range-finding test looking at the degree of corneal necrosis from various volumes and concentrations of chemicals Footnote 2. In a study conducted equivalently to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 405, 2 rabbits scored post-exposure averages (24-, 48-, and 72-hour) of 1 for corneal opacity, 0 for iritis, 1.7 for conjunctival erythema, and 0.7 for chemosis; redness, swelling, and clouding of the cornea as well as conjunctival bleeding were also observed Footnote 3. The effects of the substance on the eye disappeared after 8 days. The original BASF grading was converted into the numerical grading according to the Draize test. The available data meet the classification criteria for Eye Irritation - Category 2A [HPR 8.3.2(3)]. Respiratory Sensitization: No data available Skin Sensitization: Does not meet criteria Only 1 positive human patch test was observed in 229 patients (atopy not discussed) who worked with fluids containing the substance Footnote 4. Results were negative in a Magnusson-Kligman guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) Footnote 5. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In Vivo: Results were negative in an OECD TG 474 (Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Test) study in mice Footnote 3. In Vitro: Results were negative in multiple OECD guideline studies, including studies conducted according to OECD Guideline 471 (Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay) in Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538, both with and without metabolic activation Footnote 3,Footnote 6Footnote 7; OECD Guideline 476 (In Vitro Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Test) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, both with and without metabolic activation Footnote 3; and OECD Guideline 479 (Genetic Toxicology: In Vitro Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay in Mammalian Cells) in CHO cells, both with and without metabolic activation Footnote 3,Footnote 8. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: No data available MDEA has not been reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). No carcinogenicity studies were identified. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria Animals: In an OECD TG 421 (Reproduction / Developmental Toxicity Screening Test) good laboratory practice (GLP)-compliant study, rats (10/sex/dose) were gavaged with 0, 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day MDEA Footnote 9,Footnote 3. At 1000 mg/kg/day, the body weight in parental males and females was reduced; however, there were no adverse effects on fertility of either sex, with the gestation index at 100% in all groups. There was increased post-implantation loss in the high dose group (1,000 mg/kg/day), and the rate of delivered pups was reduced within this group. However, the live birth index was not changed, with the difference in number of stillborn pups not considered statistically significant between the groups. No adverse effects were noted in the low- and mid-dose groups. Results for reproductive toxicity were also negative in a dermal OECD Guideline 414 (Prenatal Developmental Toxicity) study Footnote 3. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity - Single Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In an acute toxicity study in rats with limited details available, rats gavaged with 1,945 mg/kg of undiluted MDEA showed signs of sluggishness, lacrimation, chromodacryorrhea, diarrhea, kyphosis and prostration Footnote 1. Survivors usually recovered from effects between 2 and 3 days after dosing. Necropsy of animals that died revealed distended stomachs containing blood with dark red or purple discolouration of the glandular portion. Survivors had no gross pathology at necropsy. While the above effects are seen at a concentration of MDEA within the guidance value range for Category 2 of this hazard class, the concentration is also the LD50 for MDEA. This makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of a single dose exposure from the overall acute toxic effects. Dermal Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In an acute study in rats exposed to unspecified doses of MDEA for 24 hours under occlusive conditions, the LD50 was reported to be 10,244 mg/kg in males and 11,336 mg/kg in females. Clinical signs of sluggishness, unsteady gait, emaciation, and prostration were observed Footnote 1. Survivors usually recovered from effects between 3 and 5 days after dosing. At necropsy, the majority of animals that had survived the study did not reveal any gross pathology, but a few showed red mottled lungs and dark red livers. Insufficient study details are available for doses at which effects occur to use for classification. Inhalation Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In an acute lethality study in rats at the saturated vapour concentration of MDEA, a 6-hour exposure caused no mortalities and no significant signs of toxicity Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity ‚Äì Single Exposure. Specific Target Organ Toxicity - Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: No data available. Dermal Route of Exposure: No human data are available. No systemic toxicity was observed in rats in a 13-week study performed according to OECD TG 411 Footnote 3. A short-term repeated-dose study in rats with nine occlusive applications over a period of 11 days was also negative Footnote 3.
