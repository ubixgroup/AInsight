Notes: The Veterinary Drugs Directorate has compiled ten years of data on the use of injectable tiletamine-zolazepam products for immobilizing wildlife in Canada. There are no approved tiletamine-zolazepam products in Canada. Access to a foreign authorized tiletamine-zolazepam product is permitted through Experimental Studies Certificates (ESC) or Emergency Drug Release (EDR) authorizations. The data collected from 2012-2022 comes from follow-up reports to authorizations for tiletamine-zolazepam products through these pathways. Follow-up reports are submitted to collect information on the product safety and the effectiveness for its intended use. This dataset compiled from the follow-up reports provides general information about how the products have been used and may be of interest to wildlife conservation officers, researchers or drug manufacturers. The dataset includes the number of animals immobilized, the species, the amount of drug used, and whether there were any adverse events or concerns with the quality of sedation. The data also indicates the province where immobilizations had taken place and any other drugs that were included in the immobilization protocol. This dataset provides information on protocols that have been used in the past, but does not replace the need to consult with a veterinarian with experience in wildlife to design or update immobilization protocols.
