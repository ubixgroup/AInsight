The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of corded window coverings with the requirements of the Corded Window Coverings Regulations. For this project, compliance of select corded window coverings with the Corded Window Coverings Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments and sampled relevant products. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating inspections, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of corded window covering companies in Canada. The market survey identified 191 different corded window covering products available to Canadians, and informed target sampling for this project. Over the course of the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, mechanical testing of 38 different products was carried out, where 29 of the 38 samples were imported products. The testing resulted in 16 recalls involving 24 products, 1 stop sale, 8 stop distributions and 5 trader commitments. All the tested products demonstrated at least one non-compliance, posing various levels of risk. Corrective actions taken by CPSP reflect the level of risk posed by each product (e.g., products posing the most risk were subject to a recall). Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Disclaimer: Inspectors apply a systematic bias during the selection of establishments and samples. Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
