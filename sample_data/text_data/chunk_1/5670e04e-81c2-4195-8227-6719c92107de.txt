Keywords: ['Traffic', 'Traffic-related air pollution', '(TRAP)', 'air pollution', 'urban areas', 'pollutants', 'vehicle exhaust', 'tire-and-brake wear', 'other particles', 'road dust', 'evaporation of fuels', 'engine components']
Notes: Traffic is a major source of air pollution especially in urban areas. Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a mixture of pollutants from vehicle exhaust, tire and brake wear, other particles such as road dust, and evaporation of fuels from engine components.

Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a mixture of pollutants from: vehicle exhaust tire and brake wear other particles such as road dust evaporation of fuels from engine components Pollutants in TRAP include: black carbon (BC) carbon monoxide (CO) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) particulate matter (PM) ultrafine particles (UFP) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) benzene and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) Many people in Canada are exposed to TRAP every day. Exposure to TRAP is highest near major roads and highways. Travelling in vehicles, working or living near busy roads, and being outdoors near traffic can increase your exposure to TRAP. In addition, people living in urban areas in Canada are exposed to moderate to heavy traffic, for an average of an hour or more a day, when travelling in a vehicle or engaging in active transportation. Health effects of traffic-related air pollution We evaluated the link between TRAP exposure and: asthma, allergies and lung function childhood leukemia, adult lung cancer and adult breast cancer We concluded that TRAP exposure: causes lung cancer in adults causes development and worsening of asthma symptoms in children likely reduces lung function likely causes childhood leukemia may cause allergies to worsen may cause breast cancer in adults may cause worsening of asthma symptoms in adults All levels of government can use the conclusions drawn from the evaluation of the scientific evidence to support programs and policies designed to reduce exposure and the health impacts of TRAP in Canada. Health impacts of traffic-related air pollution in Canada We estimate that every year in Canada, TRAP contributes to: 1,200 premature deaths 210,000 asthma symptom days 2.7 million acute respiratory symptom days We estimate the socioeconomic cost of health impacts of TRAP at $9.5B per year, based on 2015 currency. About 4 out of 10 people in Canada live within 250 metres of a high traffic roadway. This includes: highways major roads expressways arterial roads High traffic roadways are associated with a higher risk of exposure to TRAP, putting those living close to them at greater risk of adverse health effects. Many of the people who live near high traffic roadways are: seniors children lower socioeconomic groups People from these groups may be at greater risk than others of experiencing adverse health effects from exposure to air pollution including TRAP. What we're doing to reduce traffic-related air pollution We've introduced strict regulations to decrease air pollution from vehicles and engines. These regulations have resulted in reduced emissions due to: improved engine performance emission control technologies cleaner fuels, including fuels with low sulphur content Although technology improvements have reduced vehicle emissions, there's still cause for concern because: older trucks and cars remain in use these vehicles emit more pollutants and greenhouse gases than newer vehicles vehicle numbers are high in densely populated urban areas the total kilometres travelled by Canadian vehicles continues to increase Did you know? Under the National Air Pollutant Surveillance Program, dedicated roadside air monitoring sites, including in Toronto and Vancouver monitor common air pollutants and TRAP emissions in real-time. How you can help reduce traffic-related air pollution You can help to reduce TRAP emissions by: choosing alternate ways to travel such as walking, cycling, public transit or carpooling avoiding unnecessary idling of your vehicle maintaining a steady driving speed, while avoiding heavy braking or acceleration when possible maintaining your vehicle and equipment for optimal engine performance For more information, please visit the Air quality and health page or contact us at: air@hc-sc.gc.ca Poster to Share Does traffic take your breath away?
