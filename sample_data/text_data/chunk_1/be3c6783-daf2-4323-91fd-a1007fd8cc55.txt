Source: Serious ADR and MDI Action Cycle. ISMP Canada, HSO, CPSI; 2019. Text description A circle diagram depicts the action cycle for serious ADR and MDI reporting by hospitals. In summary, the figure illustrates that the care team and patients document the serious ADR or MDI. Reporting a serious ADR or MDI to Health Canada is supported by hospital systems and processes. Health Canada reviews and assesses reports and other data sources. Health Canada communicates safety findings to all Canadians, including hospitals, who are shown to share the learning. This concludes the action cycle. The diagram superimposes two yellow rectangle shape around specific parts of the action cycle. The first yellow rectangle is placed around: Health Canada, reviewing and assessing reports and other data sources The second yellow rectangle is placed around: All Canadians (including hospitals), that learn from the safety findings Health Canada communicates and shares them. Health Product Vigilance Health Canada builds post-market safety knowledge, which is integral to effective clinical use, from several data sources, including serious adverse drug reaction (serious ADR) and medical device incident (MDI) reports. In addition to serious ADR and MDI reports, a variety of other data sources contribute to therapeutic product safety monitoring, including: mandatory reports from regulated parties, voluntary reports from health care professionals and consumers, foreign data such as manufacturer assessment of worldwide safety data, information sharing with foreign regulatory agencies, medical literature, and information generated from the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN). This module reflects the broad scope of Health Canada's product vigilance activities beyond mandatory reporting by hospitals (e.g., serious ADRs and MDIs); which is reflected in the use of the AR and MDP report terminology. Health Canada's Health Product Vigilance Life Cycle Market authorization submission Product submission (pharmaceuticals, natural health products, biologics and biosimilars, radiopharmaceuticals, disinfectants and sanitizers with disinfectant claims, and medical devices) by market authorization holder (MAH) Pre-market review Reviews product submissions to assess for safety, efficacy and quality Review risk management plans with MAH to mitigate potential risks (as applicable) Assesses product name and label (depending on class for medical devices) Post-market surveillance Monitors safety and effectiveness of health products by identifying and assessing potential safety signals through multiple sources including spontaneous reporting of adverse reactions to health products and medical device problems reports, literature review, annual safety summaries, DSEN, liaising with other regulators, etc. Risk mitigation Continuing observation Labelling changes Risk communications Product recall Educational activities Market withdrawal Other Compliance and enforcement Monitors quality of adverse reaction/ medical device problem reports through compliance promotion and enforcement (e.g., inspections) Enforce regulations AR Reporting Is Essential to Post-market Surveillance Many safety issues are ONLY detected after market approval due to use of the health product in larger populations.

AR or MDP Report Received by Health Canada AR or MDP Report Processing Signal Detection Signal Prioritization Signal Assessment/Safety Review Risk Mitigation Possible Risk Communication A green arrow called "Dissemination of Findings" is placed under steps five through seven. Signal Detection and Assessment Safety signals (preliminary indications of product-related safety issues) are identified through data scanning, including review of AR and MDP reports. Potential signals are reviewed by an internal committee of scientists, pharmacists and physicians to determine if a signal assessment will be completed. Assessment from all data sources is used to consider possible risk mitigation activities. Risk considerations include strength of evidence, manageability of risk, dissemination of information, and communication targets. Following the completion of a signal assessment, recommendations are made and can include changing labels, including indication, recalling or withdrawing a product from the market, and communicating risks to stakeholders. Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act (Vanessa's Law) improves Health Canada's ability to collect post-market safety information and take appropriate action when a serious risk to health is identified.Footnote 1 Risk Communications Target Audience: Health Care Professionals / Hospitals Health Product Risk Communication Ad hoc communication about safety issues Broad dissemination (web posting, RSS feed, MedEffect™ e-Notice) Targeted dissemination by the Market Authorization Holder or by Health Canada (fax, email, mail) Health Product InfoWatch Monthly publication to raise awareness of safety issues and stimulate reporting of the same Each publication includes a monthly recap of health product advisories and summary safety reviews, as well as a growing selection of new health product safety information. Broad dissemination (web posting, Twitter, RSS feed, MedEffect™ e-Notice) Target Audience: General Public Recall Notice Written and distributed by industry; an "extract" of the information posted by Health Canada Posted at regular intervals on Health Canada's Recalls and Safety Alerts database Public Advisory Written by Health Canada for urgent, high risk issues Broad dissemination (Newswire, Twitter, RSS feed, MedEffect™ e-Notice) Targeted distribution to stakeholders as needed Information Update Written by Health Canada for less urgent, lower risk issues (e.g., labelling updates) Broad dissemination (Newswire, Twitter, RSS feed, MedEffect™ e-Notice) Foreign Product Alerts Health Canada communicates information as needed about unauthorized products from other countries which may have been brought into the country by travellers or purchased online Information Sharing from AR and MDP Reporting Information Sharing with Health System Partners Health Canada makes AR and MDP data available online, produces an annual trend report and publishes risk communications to health care stakeholders through a number of forums. Health Canada plans to continually improve its AR and MDP data analytics, ensuring health system partners have timely access to key information. Data analytics: Invest in information technology to support the timely analysis of the AR and MDP data and streamline the identification of potential safety signals Invest in the optimization of the existing AR/MDP searchable databases Sharing of information with partners, including: Health Canada's annual AR and MDP report Outreach and education activities on reporting and post-market surveillance Examples of AR and MDP Safety Information Sharing Health Canada disseminates findings to health care providers and the public to alert and educate them about identified health risks related to health products.
