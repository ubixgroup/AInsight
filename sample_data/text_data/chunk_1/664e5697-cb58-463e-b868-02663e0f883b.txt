The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of charcoal products to the requirements of the Charcoal Regulations. For this project, compliance of select charcoal-type products with the Charcoal Regulations was determined through a product label review process by which Health Canada inspectors requested product samples from targeted establishments for relevant charcoal products. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through visual label review. Prior to initiating this CV project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of charcoal companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2021-2022 fiscal year, visual label evaluation of 24 different brands of charcoal-type products was carried out. The product label review resulted in 7 voluntary recalls, 4 stop distributions and 18 trader commitments to address non-compliance. There were 5 instances where no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

No compliance issues detected None Disclaimer: A systematic bias is applied during inspection and sampling. Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
