Keywords: ['arsenic', 'inorganic arsenic', 'fruit juice', 'fruit nectar', 'apple', 'diet', 'exposure', 'food', 'maximum level', 'ML', 'arsenite', 'arsenate']
Notes: Arsenic is naturally occurring in the environment, and very low levels are present in various foods. Elevated arsenic exposure from drinking water has been associated with a variety of serious adverse health effects, with potential effects noted in vulnerable populations such as infants and children.

Health Canada has conducted a scientific assessment, provided below, which supports updating the maximum level (ML) for total arsenic in fruit juice and fruit nectar. Health Canada is proposing to lower the existing ML to values that are as low as reasonably achievable based on the fruit juice and nectar type. The lower MLs would be expressed as inorganic arsenic and apply to the juice and nectar products on an as consumed basis.

The purpose of this communication is to publically announce the Department's intention in this regard and to provide the appropriate contact information for any inquiries or for those wishing to submit any new scientific information relevant to Health Canada's proposal. Information Document Health Canada's Proposal to Update the Maximum Level for Total Arsenic in Fruit Juice and Fruit Nectar - Reference Number: NOP/ADP C-2021-2 Contact Information Health Canada's Food Directorate is committed to reviewing new scientific information on inorganic arsenic in fruit juice and fruit nectar. Anyone wishing to submit new scientific information or submit inquiries on the proposal may do so in writing, by regular mail or electronically. If you wish to contact the Food Directorate electronically, please use the words "Arsenic ML for fruit juice and fruit nectar (NOP/ADP-C-2021-2)" in the subject line of your e-mail.
