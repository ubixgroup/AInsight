The CPSP is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA) and its regulations, as well as cosmetic-related provisions of the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) and the Cosmetic Regulations. The purpose of the CCPSA is to protect the public by addressing or preventing dangers to human health or safety that are posed by consumer products in Canada, including those that circulate within Canada and those that are imported. Similarly, the purpose of the Cosmetic Regulations and the associated provisions of the FDA are to protect Canadians from risks that may be posed by cosmetics. Within Health Canada, the CPSP promotes, monitors, verifies and enforces compliance with the CCPSA and the FDA. It reviews incidentFootnote 1 reports submitted by industryFootnote 2 and consumers and regularly monitors the marketplace to identify potentially dangerous products. The CPSP also gathers information domestically and internationally about injuries, emerging issues and new science related to consumer product and cosmetic safety. This information is then used to help conduct routine sampling and testing of products in the marketplace and support partnerships with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and other domestic and international regulators to verify the compliance of products being imported into Canada. The CPSP also uses this information to evaluate risks to Canadians posed by consumer products and cosmetics. For example, it conducts assessments to understand and highlight the relative level of risk posed by a consumer product or cosmetic. This allows for the strategic assignment of program resources towards products that pose the greatest risk to Canadians. When reviewing incoming incident reports, the CPSP uses a triage-based approach to identify product-related health and safety concern for follow-up risk assessment and possible compliance and enforcement activity. It carefully monitors issues that do not require immediate attention so that it is prepared to take action if the risk changes over time. Finally, the CPSP provides credible information to consumers and provides tools to help guide informed decision-making by the public. This is the fifth publicly available Annual Surveillance Report. This report presents a summary of all incident data reported to the CPSP between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, involving products that meet either of the below definitions: A consumer product is a product, including its components, parts or accessories, that may reasonably be expected to be obtained by an individual to be used for non-commercial purposes, including for domestic, recreational and sports purposes, and includes its packaging (Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, Section 2); and A cosmetic includes any substance or mixture of substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in cleansing, improving, or altering the complexion, skin, hair, or teeth, and includes deodorants and perfumes (Food and Drugs Act, Section 2). All of the reported incidents include products that are sold within the Canadian marketplace, whether the incidents occurred domestically (69%) or internationally (31%).Footnote 3 The data has been divided by incidents pertaining to consumer products and cosmetics. Under the CCPSA, industry must report health or safety incidents involving consumer products to Health Canada. This mandatory reporting provides Health Canada with a broad understanding of health- or safety-related incidents that occur with consumer products. There are no mandatory incident reporting requirements for cosmetics under the FDA. Finally, each subdivided section provides a table to illustrate the top 10 products reported overall as well as those associated with incident reports of injuries and deaths, with information concerning the hazards and injuries mentioned in the incident report for those products. All of the injuries reported are grouped into different levels of severity (unknown, minor, or life threatening for example). These levels correspond to the overall risk that was reported and relies on factors such as: whether medical treatment was sought, whether the injury was described as being sustained by a vulnerable population and whether that injury was reversible. The categorization of consumer products was carried out using the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) coding manual. The categorization of cosmetic products was based on the function of the product using the CPSP's Notification of Cosmetics guidelines. The information in this Annual Surveillance Report reflects the information provided in the incident reports submitted to the CPSP by industry and consumers (including media articles, governmental organizations, fire services, police, coroners, etc.); it does not capture all incidents in Canada. Reports submitted to the CPSP express opinions or observations of the individuals who wrote them and may not always identify a health or safety concern with a particular product or include a thorough description of the incident. The CPSP acknowledges that a given event may be due to an underlying condition, product misuse or coincidental factors. The CPSP takes a risk-based approach and does not validate the claims of every report received. The CPSP reviews reports on an ongoing basis thus the statistics in this Annual Surveillance Report should be considered dynamic and subject to change. Consumer products Total reports received in 2021 from consumers and industry 2,738 consumer product reports were received between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021, of which 35 mentioned a death and 973 mentioned a non-fatal injury Figure 1. Number of consumer product reports received in 2021 from consumers and industry Figure 1: Text description Month reports received Number of incident reports received Incident reported by consumer Incident reported by industry Grand total January 101 104 205 February 113 88 201 March 92 148 240 April 75 258 333 May 69 105 174 June 101 116 217 July 80 102 182 August 101 127 228 September 72 111 183 October 64 93 157 November 75 91 166 December 60 392 452 Grand total 1,003 1,735 2,738 In 2021, the CPSP had an average of 228 reports received per month. This is higher than the 2020 average of 166 report per month and exceeds the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 of 195 reports per month. This spike in reporting is mostly explained by batch reporting as indicated by the spike in April and December. Batch reporting is when industry submits reports of multiple incidents at a single time. These multiple incidents may or may not be related and may have occurred in previous years. The product types that are most associated with the batch reporting-related increases are: Beds or bedframes; Desks, dressers, chests, bureaus, or buffets; and Other or not specified. Top 10 consumer products reported The CPSP received a total of 2,738 consumer product incident reports in 2021, covering 322 different product types. The majority (94%) of these product types had 25 or less incident reports submitted per product type, accounting for 54% of the total number of cases received. By comparison, the 11 most reported product types accounted for 39% of all reports received. Note that there are 11 product types listed in this category because the last two product types occupy the 10th rank as they have the same number of reports (52). Figure 2.

Conclusion Within the 2021 calendar year, the CPSP received a total of 2,871 consumer product and cosmetic reports from industry and consumers (1,751 and 1,120, respectively). This is an increase of 36% for all reports compared to 2020 (2,109 reports) and above pre-pandemic values of 2,343 total reports in 2019. In addition, there were notable increases in batch reporting by industry and reports associated with recalls. Recalls tend to increase consumer reporting by increasing awareness of incident reporting mechanisms. The 11 most reported consumer product types account for 39% of the total number of incident reports received by the CPSP in 2021. The top reported consumer product type in 2021 was 'Electric ranges or ovens', with 167 reports received, over a third of which mentioned an injury. The product type "Exercise equipment (excluding weight lifting or gymnastic equipment)" was new to the top 10, and may be associated with pandemic-related popularity of this product type and/or recalls for these product types. Finally, the CPSP saw a 9% increase in the number of reports received for cosmetic products in 2021 compared to 2020. Due to the relatively low number of reports received for cosmetic products, it is difficult to make any determinations about the changes in the number of reports received.
