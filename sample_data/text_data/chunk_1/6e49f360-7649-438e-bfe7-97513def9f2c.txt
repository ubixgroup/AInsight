The key elements of the system are: hazard classification cautionary labelling of containers the provision of safety data sheets (SDSs) worker education programs Suppliers, employers and workers each have requirements under WHMIS. Suppliers, defined as persons who, in the course of business, sell or import a hazardous product, must: identify whether their products are hazardous products prepare labels and SDSs and provide these to purchasers of hazardous products intended for use in a workplace Employers must: educate and train workers on the hazards and safe use of hazardous products in the workplace ensure that hazardous products are properly labelled prepare workplace labels and SDSs (as necessary) ensure appropriate control measures are in place to protect the health and safety of workers Workers must: participate in WHMIS and chemical safety training programs take necessary steps to protect themselves and their co-workers participate in identifying and controlling hazards Roles for implementation WHMIS is implemented through coordinated federal, provincial, and territorial legislation. This coordinated approach promotes efficiency and prevents the potential for interprovincial trade barriers. Health Canada acts as the secretariat for this federal, provincial, and territorial government partnership system. WHMIS regulators also maintain regular consultative contact with key industry and organized labour stakeholders. Health Canada administers the Hazardous Products Act and its regulations, which set labelling and SDS requirements for suppliers. Each of the 13 provincial, territorial, and federal agencies responsible for occupational health and safety has established WHMIS requirements for employers within their respective jurisdictions. The Labour Program at Employment and Social Development Canada is responsible for workplaces under federal jurisdiction.
