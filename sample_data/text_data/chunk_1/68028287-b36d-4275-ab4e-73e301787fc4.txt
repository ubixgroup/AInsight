The information required depends on the type of product and its level of risk. Before a health product is authorized for sale, Health Canada must be satisfied that: its benefits outweigh its risks the evidence supports its health claims the risks and uncertainties can be managed For biologics, like vaccines, companies may also be required to provide samples. We test the samples in our laboratories to make sure that the company is able to consistently produce a high-quality product. We post information on: drug submissions under review decisions to approve or refuse the sale of drugs and medical devices Drugs and natural health products authorized for sale by Health Canada have an 8-digit number on their labels. An authorized product will be identified with one of the following numbers: natural product number (NPN) drug identification number (DIN) homeopathic medicines number (DIN-HM) Higher-risk medical devices authorized for sale have a device identifier, which appears on the product or its packaging as either: a unique series or combination of letters or numbers, which is usually the catalogue number a bar code Health Canada makes searchable databases available with information on authorized products, including the: Drug Product Database Medical Devices Active License Listing Licensed Natural Health Products Database To make sure companies meet regulatory requirements and manufacturing standards, they must obtain licences from us for product: manufacturing packaging testing importing distributing wholesaling Our Special Access Programmes allow physicians to access certain drugs and medical devices that are not currently authorized for sale in Canada. Some health products, like drugs and certain high-risk medical devices, must first be tested in humans before they can be approved. Health Canada does not do clinical trials. However, we: review, approve and monitor clinical trials for drugs and medical devices carried out in Canada require companies to provide clinical trial evidence as part of their product applications Find a list of authorized clinical trials and the benefits and risks of participating in one. Monitoring safety and quality Sometimes, new evidence about a health product arises on a previously unknown risk. That is why once a product is authorized for sale we continue to monitor its safety. For as long as a product is available to the public, we: conduct safety reviews require that companies report on the safety of their products, including new risks evaluate changes to product formulas or designs monitor actions taken by other regulators, and share information with them review scientific literature, including published and unpublished studies collect and analyze complaints and adverse reaction reports from: companies patients and consumers health professionals If a company manufactures vaccines or other biologic drugs, we require that company to submit: the results of its own testing samples for testing in Health Canada laboratories an application to Health Canada for approval if the company changes its processes for making a product If there is a possible new safety concern with a product authorized for sale, we review available details to: confirm the risk decide how best to address the risk Depending on the severity of the concern, we may: recommend: changes to how the product can be used new warnings be added to the safety information request that the company change its: formula packaging instructions for use communicate the risks to health professionals and the public remove the product from the market Through the Chemicals Management Plan we assess and take action on potentially harmful chemical substances, including those that may be found in health products. Creating policies and setting standards All health products must meet the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act and its regulations to be legally sold in Canada. To help companies understand their requirements and responsibilities more clearly we produce: policies standards guidance documents Promoting and enforcing compliance Health Canada helps make sure companies and products meet Canada's high safety and quality standards by promoting and enforcing compliance with laws and regulations.
