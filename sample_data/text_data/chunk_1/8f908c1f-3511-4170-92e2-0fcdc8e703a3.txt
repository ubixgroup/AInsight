The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of children's plush toys with specific mechanical requirements of the Toys Regulations. For this project, compliance of plush toys with the Toys Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors sampled relevant products from both physical and online establishments. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating inspections, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of children's plush toy companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2021 to 2022 fiscal year, mechanical testing of 25 different products was carried out. One product failed to meet the requirements of the Toys Regulations. This resulted in 1 recall to address the non-compliance. There were 24 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the product subject to this enforcement action.

Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
