We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

The Licensed Natural Health Products Database contains information about natural health products that have been issued a product licence by Health Canada. This data extract contains information on NHP Products.

Products with a licence have been assessed by Health Canada and found to be safe, effective and of high quality under their recommended conditions of use. You can identify licensed natural health products by looking for the eight-digit Natural Product Number (NPN) or Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM) on the label.
