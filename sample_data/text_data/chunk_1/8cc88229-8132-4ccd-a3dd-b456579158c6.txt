Notes: Human biomonitoring is used to estimate exposure to environmental chemicals by measuring the chemical, its metabolites, or reaction products in biological specimens. Since 2007, the biomonitoring component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) has measured hundreds of chemicals in blood, urine, hair, or pooled serum. The CHMS is an ongoing national survey with data collected in two-year cycles.

Biomonitoring data are available through an interactive online tool called the Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/biomonitoring/). New data will be added to the dashboard as they become available. Information specific to the biomonitoring component of the CHMS, including general information on the survey design, fieldwork, laboratory and statistical analyses, and considerations for data interpretation can be found in Health Canada’s biomonitoring reports. These archived reports as well as biomonitoring resources such as a biomonitoring content summary and fact sheets are available on the Resources (https://health-infobase.canada.ca/biomonitoring/resources.html) tab of the Canadian Biomonitoring Dashboard. More information on the full survey can be found on the Statistics Canada website (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/survey/household/5071).

Since its launch in 2007, the survey’s principal objective has been to collect health and wellness data and biological specimens from a nationally representative sample of Canadians. Biological specimens are analyzed for indicators of health status, chronic and infectious diseases, nutritional status and environmental chemicals. This information is important for understanding and detecting emerging trends in risk factors and exposures and advancing health surveillance and research in Canada. The survey is conducted in two-year cycles, with each cycle comprising data collected from approximately 5,800 Canadians aged 3–79 at 16 collection sites across Canada. The collection sites vary from cycle to cycle and are stratified in five regions of Canada (the Atlantic provinces, Québec, Ontario, the Prairie provinces and British Columbia). The CHMS is designed as a cross-sectional survey that is representative of approximately 96%–97% of the Canadian population (Statistics Canada, 2010; Statistics Canada, 2015; Statistics Canada, 2017; Statistics Canada, 2019). Detailed descriptions of the CHMS rationale, survey design, target population, ethical considerations and sampling strategy have been published elsewhere (Beck et al., 2018; Day et al., 2007; Giroux, 2007; Labrecque and Quigley, 2014; Labrecque and Quigley, 2016; Statistics Canada, 2010; Statistics Canada, 2015; Statistics Canada, 2017; Statistics Canada, 2019; Tremblay et al., 2007). Biological specimen: a sample of material derived from a survey participant, such as blood, urine, saliva, DNA, hair or nail clippings Environmental chemical: a chemical substance, either human-made or natural, that is present in the environment and to which humans may be exposed through air, water, food, soil, dust or consumer products Individual sample: a biological specimen from a single survey participant Persistent organic pollutants: human-made or natural organic compounds that, once released into the environment, remain intact for long periods, become widely distributed geographically, accumulate in the fatty tissues of humans and wildlife, and have harmful impacts on human health and/or the environment Pooled sample: a single sample containing a combination of multiple individual samples selected using a set of grouping criteria, such as age or sex (in this report, the term "pooled sample" is also referred to as "pool") Serum: the fluid component of blood plasma remaining after clot formation The CHMS biomonitoring component measures environmental chemicals and/or their metabolites in survey participants’ blood, urine and hair. During the first five cycles of the CHMS, data for approximately 200 environmental chemicals were collected in individual samples. These data — along with background information on the selection and prioritization of environmental chemicals — have been published in Health Canada’s reports on human biomonitoring of environmental chemicals (Health Canada, 2010; Health Canada, 2015; Health Canada, 2017; Health Canada, 2019). Select persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were measured in individual plasma samples from cycle 1 (2007–2009) (Health Canada, 2010). The concentrations detected in these individual samples were frequently below the limits of detection, thereby limiting the ability to develop national means for several of these compounds. Pooling samples was proposed as a cost-effective approach to address the issue of low detection levels. This report presents national data on the concentrations of environmental chemicals measured in pooled serum collected from Canadians from 2007–2017. Pooled serum samples were included in the biomonitoring component of cycles 1, 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017) of the CHMS. Measurement in pooled serum samples was carried out for 84 environmental chemicals in cycle 1 and for 54 environmental chemicals in cycles 3, 4 and 5. Pooled serum samples were also included in cycle 6 (2018–2019). Collection for cycle 6 was completed in late 2019 and planning for future cycles is under way. A full list of the chemicals measured in pooled serum as part of four cycles of the CHMS from 2007–2017 is presented in Table 1.1. Note that pooled serum was not included as part of cycle 2 (2009–2011).

These are followed by descriptive summaries for each chemical or chemical group, outlining chemical identities, common uses, occurrences in the environment, potential sources of exposure in the human population, toxicokinetics and health effects, Canadian regulatory status and existing Canadian biomonitoring data. Information on the general CHMS survey and the biomonitoring component (individual samples) has been published previously (Health Canada, 2010; Health Canada, 2013; Health Canada, 2015; Health Canada, 2017; Health Canada, 2019; Statistics Canada, 2020). A complete list of chemicals that have been measured or are planned for measurement in pooled and individual blood and urine samples collected as part of the CHMS is available online (Health Canada, 2020). Data tables specific to each chemical are provided below the relevant summaries. The tables are broken down by age group and sex, and contain descriptive statistics on the distribution of pooled serum concentrations in the sample population. Data from all cycles are presented together in tables for ease of comparison. Downloadable tables are available in comma-separated values (CSV) format through the Government of Canada's open data portal. Data from all components of the CHMS are available to scientists through Statistics Canada's Research Data Centres Program, and are a resource for additional scientific analyses.

Statistics Canada Catalogue no. 82-003-S. 2 Objectives The primary purpose of the pooled serum biomonitoring component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is to provide estimates of environmental chemical concentrations in the Canadian population. These estimates can be used to assess chemical exposures and develop policies to reduce Canadians' exposure to toxic chemicals to protect their health. The pooled serum biomonitoring component was added to the survey to enable analyses of certain environmental chemicals — namely persistent organohalogens — that are difficult to quantify in individual samples. In individual samples, the small blood volume available and low concentrations generally result in a low frequency of detectable results. In addition, the cost of sensitive analytical methods for measuring these persistent organohalogens can be prohibitive. These limitations are addressed by pooling samples: the pools produce larger sample volumes and reduce the number of samples being analyzed, thereby enabling the use of more sensitive analytical techniques, reducing overall costs and increasing the detection frequency such that national estimates of chemical concentrations can be established. Specific uses of the CHMS pooled serum biomonitoring data include: establishing baseline concentrations of chemicals in Canadians providing information for setting priorities and taking action to reduce Canadians' exposure to environmental chemicals and protect their health assessing the effectiveness of health and environmental risk management actions intended to reduce exposures and health risks from specific chemicals contributing to international monitoring programs, such as the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants 3 Pooling design and collection The pooled serum biomonitoring component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) was designed to address the need for nationally representative data on current population exposures to persistent organohalogens in Canada. This information is important in understanding exposure to risk factors, detecting emerging trends in risk factors and exposures, and advancing health surveillance and research in Canada. The strategy for creating pools was developed by Statistics Canada (Verret and Giroux, 2010) and designed to meet three specific criteria: allow estimates for each age group and sex yield estimates with as little bias as possible provide quality indicators or measures of variance This section provides an overview of the sample size and allocation, blood collection, pool formation and methodology, and variance estimation. 3.1 Sample size and allocation To meet the objective of producing reliable estimates at the national level by age group and sex, the CHMS requires a sample of at least 500 persons in each of the six age groups (3–5, 6–11, 12–19, 20–39, 40–59 and 60–79 years) and of each sex (except in the 3–5-year group), for a total of 11 groups. Cycle 1 (2007–2009) did not include the 3–5-year age group, and subsequent cycles were not designed to provide estimates for the individual sexes for this age group. Participants were sampled from 16 collection sites across Canada. Within each cycle, collection sites were allocated to the five Canadian regions in proportion to population size, with two sites allocated to the Atlantic region (except in cycle 1, where only one site was allocated), four to the Québec region, six to the Ontario region, two to the Prairies region and two to British Columbia. 3.2 Blood collection Biospecimen collection for the CHMS was carried out with consenting survey participants through visits to mobile examination centres (MECs). Detailed descriptions of the MEC operations and logistics for cycles 1, 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017) have been published (Bryan et al., 2007; Statistics Canada, 2010; Statistics Canada, 2015; Statistics Canada, 2017; Statistics Canada, 2019). Some CHMS participants were randomly selected to fast prior to their MEC appointments. Those selected were required to fast for at least 10 hours. Shorter fasting durations were allowed for others. Pregnant women, people with diabetes, children under six years of age, and other special cases were not asked to fast even if they had initially been flagged for fasting. The target fasted subsample size was 2,500 participants aged 6–79 for each cycle. All blood specimens collected in the MEC were processed and aliquoted in the MEC. Blood specimens were drawn by a certified phlebotomist; the maximum amount depended upon the age of the participant and consent to storage. The approximate volumes drawn over cycles 1, 3, 4 and 5 ranged from 22.0 mL in 3–5-year-olds to 83.0 mL in 20–79-year-olds (Health Canada, 2010; Health Canada, 2015; Health Canada, 2017; Health Canada, 2019). For the pooled serum biomonitoring component, blood was collected in Vacutainer Serum Separator Tubes and centrifuged to separate serum. In cycles 3, 4 and 5, a minimum volume of 0.5 mL of serum from each participant was aliquoted, and samples were then frozen for storage in the MEC. To maintain sample integrity, all specimens were stored as soon as processing was complete. A four-hour time limit from the point of collection was set for blood samples to be processed and stored; however, for most samples, this was completed within two hours. Once a week, the specimens were shipped on dry ice to the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada). Samples were stored at -80°C until ready for pooling and analyses. In cycle 1, the pooled serum biomonitoring component was conducted as a secondary study to the original survey. The serum samples used to create the pools were the volume (approximately 0.4 mL per individual) remaining after nutritional biomarker analyses were complete. These serum samples were shipped on dry ice to the reference laboratory in the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada) for pooling and analyses. Samples were stored at -80°C until ready for extraction and analyses. 3.3 Pool formation and methodology To simplify laboratory handling and minimize errors related to pooling, the pools were created using the same quantity of specimen from each participant. This approach limited the total quantity of specimen available for the pools. For cycle 1, it was determined that 0.35 mL of serum was available per participant. For the analyses in that cycle, a minimum volume of 25 mL of serum was required per pool to measure contaminant concentration levels. This meant that the pools required serum from at least 71 individuals. In an effort to account for all forms of non-response, serum from 80 participants was combined. “Non-response” included insufficient volume, sample loss during handling, and individual refusal to participate in future studies or share data with Health Canada. Given these constraints, 59 pools were formed for cycle 1. The pools were distributed by sex and age groups (6–11, 12–19, 20–39, 40–59 and 60–79 years) and did not consider fasting status. The pools comprised specimens from 57–120 individuals, corresponding to total serum pool volumes of 20–42 mL (mean: 27.2 mL) and a total of 4,583 individual participants. Some pools had a high number of individuals with insufficient serum volume, resulting in less than the targeted minimum of 71 individuals. A similar pooling protocol was used for cycles 3, 4 and 5, with 0.35 mL serum from each participant used to create pools of at least 80 participants with a minimum total volume of 25 mL. To ensure the minimum target of 71 individuals was met for each pool, participants for whom no blood was collected (or where the remaining volume of serum was less than 0.35 mL) were dropped prior to creating the pools. In all, 65 pools were formed for cycle 3 and 67 for cycles 4 and 5. The pools were distributed by age groups (3–5, 6–11, 12–19, 20–39, 40–59 and 60–79 years) and sex (except for those aged 3–5 years). Each pool comprised 71–133 individuals from the approximately 5,500 participants.

The method took into account the survey design and aimed to produce mean estimates as close as possible to those obtained for individual data (Verret and Giroux 2010). The CHMS is a sample survey, meaning that the participants represent many other Canadians not surveyed. To ensure the results would be representative of the entire population, Statistics Canada generated sample weights for each group of pooled samples and incorporated them into all estimates presented in the data tables (e.g., arithmetic means). The pool survey weights were calculated from the survey weights for each participant included in the pool. An adjustment factor was applied to correct for the survey weights of omitted participants. Participants were omitted if they were considered non-responsive, usually due to insufficient volume, sample loss during handling, or refusal to participate in future studies or share data with Health Canada. 3.4 Variance estimation The theory of dependent random groups was used to calculate an estimate of the variance with a conservative bias (Särndal et al., 1992; Verret and Giroux, 2010). In this method, two replicates (dependent random groups) were created, with each replicate including all age–sex groups and an equal number of collection sites randomly assigned from each of the five CHMS regions (the Atlantic provinces, Québec, Ontario, the Prairie provinces and British Columbia). In cycle 1, only one collection site was sampled in the Atlantic region; as such, it was grouped with the Québec region prior to being assigned to a replicate. In cycles 3, 4 and 5, the Atlantic region included two collection sites; as a result, no grouping of regions was required. Once formed, the replicates were adjusted so that an estimate from each would reflect the Canadian population. The serum pools were then constructed with individuals from the sites assigned to that replicate for each age and sex combination. A simulation study was carried out to measure the stability of the point estimates (arithmetic mean) and variance estimates (coefficient of variation [CV]) for data obtained from pooled samples (Verret and Giroux, 2010). The pooling strategy was simulated from a subsample of individual measurements from cycle 1. Based upon this study, the CV of the arithmetic mean was stable, which indicates that the point estimates themselves are stable. However, the variance estimates obtained from the dependent random groups were found to be very unstable. As such, the CV should only be considered accurate within an order of magnitude. Other measures of variance estimation, such as confidence intervals — or statistical approaches that rely on variance, such as hypothesis testing — should be avoided. This includes drawing definitive conclusions when comparing results over cycles or with other biomonitoring surveys. Despite the unstable variance estimation resulting from sample pooling, the point estimates provided here are considered accurate and reliable. 3.5 Missing data Missing data in the CHMS pooled serum biomonitoring data set refers to pools for which the concentration of a chemical is unknown due to sample loss resulting from issues encountered during laboratory analyses. While every effort was made to minimize sample loss, issues during analyses were often the result of human error. Sources of sample loss included issues with sample handling, sample preparation and instrumentation. Differences in laboratory methods resulted in some chemicals being more susceptible to losses. For example, in each cycle of the CHMS, data were missing for up to seven pools in the dioxin, furan and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl analyses while data were missing for at most one pool from the polychlorinated biphenyl analyses. Concentrations presented in the data tables of this report for chemicals impacted by sample loss were calculated using imputed values for the missing data. Specifically, values for these pools were imputed using the weighted mean of available results for the age/sex group that the missing pool represented. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the point estimates, imputation by the mean was limited to a weighted maximum of 10% of pools for each target population for which data are presented. Imputation also impacts variance estimation; additional caution should be exercised when interpreting the CV for groups with missing pools and imputed data. Arithmetic means and other descriptive statistics and quality indicators were not calculated for population groups impacted by significant sample loss. References Bryan, S., St-Denis, M., Wojtas, D.

Assemblée annuelle de la SSC. 4 Laboratory analyses Laboratory analyses of environmental chemicals were performed at Health Canada analytical laboratories. The laboratories developed standardized operating procedures for the analytical methods used to measure environmental chemicals or their metabolites in serum pools. Analytical accuracy and measurement precision were evaluated through rigorous method validation programs at each laboratory. To ensure ongoing accuracy and precision of results, several quality control measures were employed as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). The methods and quality control protocols used in the analyses of the environmental chemicals are described below. 4.1 Dioxins, furans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin), polychlorinated dibenzofuran (furan) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) analyses in serum pools from cycle 1 (2007–2009) were performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). The analytical methods and quality control procedures for cycle 1 are described in detail elsewhere (Rawn et al., 2012). Dioxin, furan and dioxin-like PCB analyses in serum pools from cycles 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017) were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada) (Health Canada, 2019a). These analyses measured seven dioxin congeners, 10 furan congeners and four coplanar dioxin-like PCBs in all four cycles. Pooled serum samples were aliquoted and spiked with isotopically labelled standards of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs. Samples were then homogenized in a mixture of ethanol, saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate and hexane. Solvent was extracted and digested in concentrated sulphuric acid to remove lipids. Samples were then subjected to secondary clean-up and fractionation via tandem cesium silicate and Florisil columns followed by carbon columns. Recovery standards were added to the final sample extract. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using high-resolution >gas chromatography/high-resolution selected ion mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS). Quality control was ensured by evaluating a reagent blank and a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material (SRM) with every sample batch. The laboratory also participated in the Interlaboratory Comparison Program for Dioxins and Furans in Serum offered by the Centre de toxicologie du Québec (CTQ), Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec (INSPQ) (INSPQ, 2020b). The results of the quality control measures from reference materials and external assessment programs were consistently within the acceptable ranges set by the proficiency testing providers. 4.2 Flame retardants 4.2.1 Hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol A Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) analyses in serum pools from cycle 1 were performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Analytical methods and quality control procedures for cycle 1 are described in detail elsewhere (Rawn et al., 2014). HBCD and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) analyses in serum pools from cycles 3, 4 and 5 were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada) (Health Canada, 2018a). These analyses measured three HBCD isomers (α-HBCD, β-HBCD and γ-HBCD) in all four cycles and TBBPA in cycles 3, 4 and 5. Pooled serum samples were aliquoted and spiked with isotopically labelled standards of each analyte. Samples were extracted using a hexane and tert-butyl methyl ether solution. The resulting extract was passed through an acidified silica gel column to collect a first fraction containing HBCD eluted with hexane and a second fraction containing TBBPA eluted with dichloromethane. The two fractions were then subjected to secondary clean-up with sulphuric acid and reconstituted in a methanol and water solution. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Quality control was ensured by evaluating in-house pooled serum spiked with HBCD and TBBPA standards with every sample batch. Results of in-house quality control measures were consistently within the acceptable ranges set by the laboratory (± 30%). 4.2.2 Polybrominated diphenyl ethers Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) analyses in serum pools from cycle 1 were performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Analytical methods and quality control procedures for cycle 1 are described in detail elsewhere (Rawn et al., 2014). PBDE analyses in serum pools from cycles 3, 4 and 5 were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada) (Health Canada, 2019b). These analyses measured 23 PBDEs in cycle 1 and five PBDEs in cycles 3, 4 and 5. Pooled serum samples were aliquoted and spiked with isotopically labelled standards of PBDEs. Samples were then homogenized in a mixture of ethanol, saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate and hexane. Solvent was extracted and digested in concentrated sulphuric acid to remove lipids. Samples were then subjected to secondary clean-up and fractionation via tandem cesium silicate and Florisil columns followed by a carbon column. Recovery standards were added to the final sample extract. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using high-resolution GC/HRMS. Quality control was ensured by evaluating a reagent blank and a NIST SRM with every sample batch. The laboratory also participated in the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Ring Test for Persistent Organic Pollutants in Human Serum offered by the CTQ, INSPQ, Québec, Canada (INSPQ, 2020a). The results of quality control measures from reference materials and external assessment programs were consistently within the acceptable ranges set by the proficiency testing providers. 4.3 Organochlorine pesticides Organochlorine pesticide and metabolite analyses in serum pools from cycle 1 were performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Analytical methods and quality control procedures for cycle 1 were the same as those conducted for the measurement of PCBs and are described in detail elsewhere (Rawn et al., 2012). Organochlorine analyses in serum pools from cycles 3, 4 and 5 were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada) (Health Canada, 2018b). These analyses measured hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor (a chlordane component), oxychlordane (a chlordane metabolite), and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (a dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolite) in all four cycles. Also measured were mirex and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane in cycle 1, as well as endosulfan (endosulfan I and II) and another dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolite (o,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) in cycles 3, 4 and 5. Pooled serum samples were aliquoted and spiked with isotopically labelled standards of each analyte. Samples were then extracted using a mixture of ethanol, saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate, and hexane. The organic fraction was isolated using liquid–liquid extraction. Samples were then subjected to secondary clean-up via gel permeation chromatography using a porous cross-linked polystyrene polymer gel and cyclohexane-dichloromethane. Samples were transferred to autosampler vials and reconstituted in nonane. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/MS/MS) with MRM. Quality control was ensured by evaluating a reagent blank and a NIST SRM with every sample batch. The laboratory also participated in the AMAP Ring Test for Persistent Organic Pollutants in Human Serum offered by the CTQ, INSPQ, Québec, Canada (INSPQ, 2020a). Results of quality control measures from reference materials and external assessment programs were consistently within the acceptable ranges set by the proficiency testing providers. 4.4 Polychlorinated biphenyls Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) analyses in serum pools from cycle 1 were performed by the Food Research Division at Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Analytical methods and quality control procedures for cycle 1 are described in detail elsewhere (Rawn et al., 2012). PCB analyses in serum pools from cycles 3, 4 and 5 were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada) (Health Canada, 2019c). These analyses measured 32 PCBs in cycle 1 and 17 PCBs in cycles 3, 4 and 5. Pooled serum samples were aliquoted and spiked with isotopically labelled standards of PCBs. Samples were then homogenized in a mixture of ethanol, saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate and hexane. Solvent was extracted and digested in concentrated sulphuric acid to remove lipids. Samples were then subjected to secondary clean-up and fractionation via tandem cesium silicate and Florisil columns. Recovery standards were added to the final sample extract. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using high-resolution GC/HRMS. Quality control was ensured by evaluating a reagent blank and a NIST SRM with every sample batch. The laboratory also participated in the AMAP Ring Test for Persistent Organic Pollutants in Human Serum offered by the CTQ, INSPQ, Québec, Canada (INSPQ, 2020a). Results of quality control measures from reference materials and external assessment programs were consistently within the acceptable ranges set by the proficiency testing providers. 4.5 Lipids Lipid content determination of serum pools from cycle 1 was performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Lipid content determination of serum pools from cycles 3, 4 and 5 was performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (Ontario, Canada). This analysis measured the weight of lipid relative to the weight of serum. Lipid content was determined gravimetrically in cycles 1, 3 and 5. The crude sample was extracted in hexane and dried under a gentle stream of high-purity nitrogen to achieve a constant weight. Following lipid determination, samples were re-dissolved in hexane before proceeding with the chemical analyses. In cycle 4, lipid content was determined following a modified version of the AOAC official method 996.06 (AOAC, 2001). Serum pools were aliquoted and lipids were hydrolyzed with a mixture of hydrochloric acid and ethanol, then extracted with a mixture of hexane and ethyl ether. The extracted fatty acids were methylated in a transesterification process using boron trifluoride in methanol. Finally, quantification was performed using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection before an empirical correction (based on the analysis of AMAP proficiency test samples) was applied to account for lipids not captured by the above transesterification process. Measures of lipid content were comparable across all four cycles. References AOAC International (2001).

Environment International, 63, 26–34. 5 Statistical data analyses Descriptive statistics and quality indicators for the concentrations of environmental chemicals in pooled samples were generated using the Statistical Analysis System software (SAS Institute Inc., version 9.4, 2013). Data tables are presented for each chemical measured in pooled samples from cycle 1 (2007–2009), 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and/or 5 (2016–2017). The tables include the total number of pools, the minimum concentrations, the maximum concentrations, the weighted arithmetic means and the coefficients of variation (CVs) associated with the arithmetic means. For each chemical, results are presented for the total population aged 6–79 in cycle 1; aged 3–79 in cycles 3, 4 and 5; and in some cases, both, for comparison purposes. Results are also presented by age group and sex. LODs for each chemical and survey cycle are provided alongside the respective data table and collectively in Appendix A. LODs are provided in lipid-adjusted units. Some chemicals measured in pooled serum have constant LODs across all samples analyzed. This includes organochlorine pesticides and metabolites, hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol A in cycles 3, 4 and 5. For these chemicals, the LOD value is provided alongside the respective data tables and in Appendix A. Other chemicals have an individual LOD for each pool, as the LOD can vary based on the amount of pooled serum analyzed and with daily fluctuations in instrument performance. This includes all chemicals in cycle 1 and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers in cycles 3, 4 and 5. For these chemicals, the mean LOD values for cycles 1, 3, 4 and 5 are provided alongside the respective data tables and in Appendix A. The LOD range (minimum to maximum) is also provided in Appendix A for cycles 3, 4 and 5. Measurements that fell below the LOD for the laboratory analytical method were assigned a value equal to half the constant LOD or the individual LOD, depending on the type of LOD reported. Pools with missing data due to sample loss were assigned a value equal to the weighted mean of available results for the age/sex group that the missing pool represented. If the proportion of results below the LOD was greater than 40% or the weighted proportion of results with data missing was greater than 10%, arithmetic means were not calculated. When the result for at least one pool was below the LOD, the minimum concentration was reported as <LOD. When the results for all pools were below the LOD, the maximum concentration was also reported as <LOD. For most chemicals, the maximum concentration presented is a measured value. However, there are some instances where the maximum LOD was over twice the highest measured concentration and, as a result, the maximum concentration presented is an imputed LOD. The environmental chemicals measured in serum pools are lipophilic and concentrate in the body’s lipid stores, including in serum. Lipid content of the serum pools was measured at the time of sample analysis. Data for these chemicals were adjusted for lipid content and are presented as the weight of chemical per gram of lipid. Separate tables present unadjusted data as the weight of chemical per whole weight of serum to allow for comparison with studies using these units. Under the Statistics Act, Statistics Canada is required to ensure participant confidentiality. Most estimates presented in the data tables are based on a small number of pooled samples. However, since many individual participants are represented in these pooled samples, it is not possible to extract information about any one individual. Therefore, point estimates based on a small number of pooled samples are not suppressed. 6 Considerations for interpreting the pooled serum biomonitoring data The pooled serum biomonitoring component of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) was designed to provide estimates of environmental chemical concentrations in the Canadian population. The survey is nationally representative. The first cycle covers approximately 96% of the Canadian population aged 6–79, while subsequent cycles cover approximately 96%–97% of the Canadian population aged 3–79. The pools were created across collection sites; as such, the pooling strategy does not permit breakdown of data by region, province or collection site. In addition, the CHMS design did not target specific exposure scenarios; consequently, it did not select or exclude participants on the basis of their potential for low or high exposures to environmental chemicals. Biomonitoring in pooled samples provides an estimate of how much of a chemical is present in a population. The absence of a chemical does not necessarily mean a population has not been exposed. While the ability to measure environmental chemicals at very low concentrations has advanced in recent years, the technology may not be capable of detecting current exposures for certain chemicals. While most persistent organohalogens are measured as the parent compound or specific congener, some organochlorines are measured as metabolites. Parent compounds may be broken down or metabolized in the body into one or more metabolites. For example, the organochlorine pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane is broken down into several metabolites, including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane. Biomonitoring cannot tell us the source or route of exposure. The amount of chemical measured indicates the total amount that has entered the population via all routes (ingestion, inhalation and skin contact) and from all sources (air, water, soil, food and consumer products). The detection of the chemical may be the result of exposure to a single source or multiple sources. In addition, in most cases, biomonitoring cannot distinguish between natural and anthropogenic sources. Some chemicals, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (furans), occur naturally in the environment and are also present in human-made products. While it is not possible to attribute exposures to specific sources or routes, CHMS data from individual samples have been used to support research on the predictors of exposure to certain chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Singh et al., 2019). However, the pooling of samples limits the ability to examine these links, as the pooling design did not consider predictors of exposure. The presence alone of a chemical in a population does not necessarily mean it will cause a health effect. Factors such as the dose, the toxicity of the chemical and the duration and timing of exposure are important to determine whether potential adverse health effects may occur. CHMS data from individual samples have been used as evidence to support research on the potential links between exposure to certain chemicals and specific health effects. However, the pooling of samples limits the ability to examine these links, as health end points were not considered in the pooling design. For some chemicals, such as PCBs, research studies have provided a general understanding of the population-level health risks associated with different concentrations in blood (ANSES, 2010). From a screening perspective, biomonitoring equivalents (BEs) have been developed based upon existing exposure guidance values, and are a tool to help interpret biomonitoring data in a health-risk context at the population level (Hays et al., 2008). BEs have been used to screen existing biomonitoring data from the CHMS (Faure et al., 2020; St-Amand et al., 2014). However, for many chemicals, further research is needed to understand the potential health effects, if any, associated with different blood concentrations. Further, certain populations — such as children, pregnant women, the elderly or those who are immunocompromised — may be more susceptible to the effects of exposure. 6.1 Considerations for data analysis Pooled serum data from cycle 1 (2007–2009) for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, furans, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were published previously (Rawn et al., 2012; Rawn et al., 2014). The statistical approach used by Statistics Canada in the development of the data included in these previous publications differs from that used in the current report. In addition, there was a problem identified with the original imputation of measurements that fell below the limits of detection (LODs) used by Rawn et al., that has been rectified for this report. As a result, the previously published data are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report. 6.1.1 Instability of variance estimates Estimates such as the arithmetic mean from a sample survey inevitably include sampling errors. Measurements of the possible scope of sampling errors are based on the standard error of the estimates drawn from the survey results. To get a better indication of the size of the standard error, it is often more useful to express the standard error in terms of the estimate being measured. The resulting measure, the coefficient of variation (CV), is obtained by dividing the standard deviation of the estimate by the estimate itself, and is expressed as a percentage of the estimate. For the pooled serum biomonitoring component of the CHMS, variance estimates including CVs are unstable due to the small number of pools (57–69) and collection sites (15–16) for each cycle. Without stable CVs, it is not recommended to generate confidence interval estimates or to conduct hypothesis testing. The instability of the CVs limits the extent of analyses that can be done with pooled serum data from the CHMS. The CHMS pooled serum biomonitoring data set includes arithmetic means and accompanying CVs for the total population and subpopulations (sex and age group) for the substances measured in cycle 1 (2007–2009), cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). It is important to note that although arithmetic means may be compared across cycles or among subpopulations, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether they are statistically or meaningfully different from each other without the option of generating confidence intervals or conducting hypothesis testing. Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting the data. This is especially the case for comparisons of arithmetic means with high CVs. The following guidelines, adapted from those used by Statistics Canada, are provided for interpreting arithmetic means based on their CVs: When a CV is below 16.6%, an arithmetic mean may be considered reliable. When a CV is between 16.6% and 33.3%, an arithmetic mean may be considered less reliable due to the high sampling variability associated with the estimate; data should be used with caution. When a CV is greater than 33.3%, an arithmetic mean may be considered the least reliable due to the very high sampling variability associated with the estimate; data should be used with a high degree of caution. Some arithmetic means were calculated using imputed data to account for missing pools. Additional caution should be exercised when interpreting the CV for these arithmetic means as imputation can impact variance estimation. 6.1.2 Variation between cycles For those chemicals measured in multiple cycles, it is important to note that changes in analytical methods across cycles may contribute to variations in results. The LODs for certain analytical methods have changed from cycle to cycle as a result of improvements to analytical methods (Appendix A). As a result, there may be some instances where results were reported as <LOD in a past cycle and as a concentration >LOD in a more recent cycle. This difference in LODs should be considered when interpreting data from multiple cycles. 6.1.3 Comparability with individual data Pooled sample data are equivalent to the arithmetic mean of the results from each individual sample in the pool. In individual samples, estimates of central tendency are best made using a geometric mean due to the log-normal distribution of the data. In other words, the geometric mean is preferable for individual sample data because it is less influenced by a small number of high values that are common when measuring chemicals in biological samples. For these types of data with log-normal distribution, arithmetic means are expected to be higher than geometric means. Therefore, the arithmetic means presented for the pooled sample data are expected to be higher than the geometric means of individual sample data reported elsewhere, including in Health Canada’s reports on human biomonitoring of environmental chemicals. The difference between arithmetic and geometric means should be considered when comparing results from pooled sample data with those of individual sample data. 6.1.4 Lipid adjustment The environmental chemicals measured in pooled serum — namely, persistent organohalogens — are lipophilic, and concentrate in lipid stores within the body. As such, data were adjusted for serum lipid content and are presented on a lipid weight basis, as is commonly and routinely done for these chemicals (HHEAR, 2020). Data are also presented on a serum weight basis for comparison with studies in which lipids were not measured. It is worth noting that serum lipid levels can be affected by variables such as sex, age, fasting status and body mass index (BMI), which may result in differences among demographic and sampling groups within a single cycle (Costanza et al., 2005). In addition, a subset (approximately half) of the CHMS participants aged 6–79 fasted for a minimum of 10 hours prior to blood sampling. For data presented on a serum weight basis, concentrations of lipophilic chemicals are generally higher in non-fasting samples than in fasting samples (Phillips et al., 1989). However, correcting for total serum lipids results in similar chemical concentrations in fasting and non-fasting samples (Phillips et al., 1989).

This group comprises 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins) and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofurans (furans) (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998). Of the 210 congeners, 17 are considered of greatest concern to human health. These congeners were measured as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and are listed in Table 7.1.1 and Table 7.1.2. Table 7.1.1 Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey cycle 1 (2007–2009), cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017) Compound name CASRN 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) 1746-01-6 1,2,3,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD) 40321-76-4 1,2,3,4,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) 39227-28-6 1,2,3,6,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) 57653-85-7 1,2,3,7,8,9-Hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD) 19408-74-3 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-Heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HpCDD) 35822-46-9 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-Octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) 3268-87-9 Table 7.1.2 Polychlorinated dibenzofurans measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey cycle 1 (2007–2009), cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017) Compound name CASRN 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzofuran (TCDF) 51207-31-9 1,2,3,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) 57117-41-6 2,3,4,7,8-Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) 57117-31-4 1,2,3,4,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF) 70648-26-9 1,2,3,6,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF) 57117-44-9 1,2,3,7,8,9-Hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF) 72918-21-9 2,3,4,6,7,8-Hexachlorodibenzofuran (HxCDF) 60851-34-5 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-Heptachlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF) 67562-39-4 1,2,3,4,7,8,9-Heptachlorodibenzofuran (HpCDF) 55673-89-7 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9-Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF) 39001-02-0 Dioxins and furans are produced from natural processes — such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions — and as a result of anthropogenic activities (Health Canada, 2006). Incineration processes are a major anthropogenic source, and include accidental burning of transformers and electrical equipment as well as intentional burning of materials such as household trash, municipal and medical waste, treated woods and fossil fuels. Other sources of anthropogenic releases are metal processing, chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper, electrical power generation, tobacco smoke and manufacturing of chemicals, such as pesticides (Health Canada, 2006). Dioxins and furans are not used commercially or produced intentionally by industry (except for scientific research purposes); rather, they are generated as impurities during the manufacture of other chemicals or products (ATSDR, 1994). Dioxins and furans enter the environment mainly through air and are found in the environment throughout the world (WHO, 2010). Once in the atmosphere, they can undergo long-range transport (Health Canada, 2006). The highest levels of these chemicals are found in soils, sediments and foods (WHO, 2010). In the environment, dioxins and furans are bioaccumulative and persistent. These properties are more pronounced in higher chlorinated congeners and congeners with specific positions of chlorination (WHO, 2010). TCDD has an estimated half-life in surface soil of 9–15 years and in subsurface soil of 25–100 years (Paustenbach et al. 1992). Even though levels have decreased, dioxins and furans are still present in the environment from historical releases and, in certain cases, industrial or agricultural incidents (EPA, 2019; WHO, 2016). The primary route of exposure in the general population is the ingestion of foods, including breast milk (Health Canada, 2006). Because of their lipophilic properties, higher levels of dioxins and furans are generally found in certain fat-containing foods, such as meats, dairy products, eggs and fish (ATSDR, 1998; Consonni et al., 2012; EPA, 2019). Dioxin and furan exposure may also occur through air, drinking water and consumer products; however, exposure from these sources is very low (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998). Although dioxins and furans are readily absorbed following oral exposure, the rate of absorption is specific to each congener and the vehicle used (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998). Once in the bloodstream, these compounds are carried by serum lipids and lipoproteins. They are stored mainly in lipid-rich tissues, with the highest concentrations found in the liver, adipose tissue, skin and muscle (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998; Aylward et al., 2008). Data from experimental studies demonstrated that fetuses might be exposed to dioxins and furans via the placenta (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998; Lampa et al., 2018). The extent of metabolism and accumulation depend on the number of chlorine atom substitutions, with more chlorinated substances undergoing greater accumulation (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998). Dioxins and furans can be measured in breast milk, adipose tissue and blood or its components, including whole blood, plasma and serum (Patterson et al., 1988). These chemicals are slowly excreted from the body, mainly via feces, but can also be excreted efficiently through breast milk. Estimated half-lives differ between congeners, and range from 2–15 years in adults (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998; Aylward et al., 2008). Serum levels of dioxins and furans are used to assess human exposures to these chemicals in the general population (Aylward et al., 2008). Most, if not all, toxic effects of dioxins and furans are mediated through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Acute ingestion of dioxins and furans induces hepatotoxicity and chloracne, characterized by persistent skin lesions (Marinković et al., 2010; WHO, 2010). Chronic exposure can lead to reproductive, developmental and neurodevelopmental effects as well as endocrine and immune system toxicity (WHO, 2010). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (2012) has classified TCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF as Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans) and other dioxins and furans as Group 3 (not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans). The toxicities of dioxin and furan mixtures can be expressed in terms of toxic equivalents (TEQs), which can be used to evaluate the human health risks posed by these complex mixtures (Consonni et al., 2012; WHO, 2010). An overview of the TEQ approach is provided in Appendix B. Dioxins and furans are listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999). They are also classified as persistent organic pollutants by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Canada, 1999; Environment Canada, 2013a; Environment Canada, 2013b; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers dioxins and furans to be persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic; as such, they are targeted for full life cycle management (Track 2 substances) (Environment Canada, 2013a; Environment Canada, 2013b; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 1990). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to control and, if possible, eliminate releases of these substances into the environment (Health Canada, 2006). These actions include: Canada-wide standards to minimize the release of dioxins and furans from municipal solid waste and hazardous waste incinerators, coastal pulp and paper boilers, iron sintering plants and electric arc furnaces; regulations requiring the virtual elimination of dioxin and furan release from pulp mills; and multi-pollutant approaches for other sectors, including base metals smelting, diesel fuel combustion, electric power generation and wood treatment. TCDD is also a prohibited ingredient on the List of Prohibited and Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients (more commonly referred to as the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, or simply the Hotlist), an administrative tool that Health Canada uses to communicate to manufacturers and others that certain substances, when present in a cosmetic, may not comply with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act or the Cosmetic Regulations (Health Canada, 2019). This list also provides limits for other dioxins and furans that might be present as impurities during triclosan manufacturing (Health Canada, 2019). Dioxins and furans are analyzed as part of Health Canada's ongoing Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016) as well by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency as part of its ongoing monitoring and surveillance activities. These survey activities demonstrate that dioxin and furan concentrations in foods sold in Canada have decreased in the past 25 years. Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to reduce the unintentional releases of dioxins and furans through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Dioxins and furans have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study of pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools. Detectable levels were reported for three dioxin congeners (1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, HpCDD and OCDD) and six furan congeners (1,2,3,7,8- PeCDF, 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF, 1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF and OCDF). HpCDD and OCDD were the most highly detected congeners, with mean concentrations ranging from 5.5–55 pg/g lipid for HpCDD and from 5.3–280 pg/g lipid for OCDD. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. Detectable levels were reported for three dioxin congeners (1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, HpCDD and OCDD) and three furan congeners (1,2,3,4,7,8-HxCDF, 1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDF and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF). As in the other regional biomonitoring studies, HpCDD and OCDD were the most highly detected congeners. Concentrations ranged from 8.9–16 pg/g lipid for HpCDD and from 90–110 pg/g lipid for OCDD. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for dioxins and furans. Detectable levels were reported for three dioxin congeners (1,2,3,6,7,8-HxCDD, HpCDD and OCDD) and two furan congeners (2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF and 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF). HpCDD and OCDD were the most highly detected congeners, with geometric mean concentrations of 5.33 pg/g lipid for HpCDD and 60.18 pg/g lipid for OCDD. Seventeen dioxin and furan congeners (Table 7.1.1 and 7.1.2) were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1 (2007–2009) and aged 3–79 in cycles 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017). Data from these cycles are presented as pg/g lipid and pg/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of dioxin and furan congeners in serum is an indicator of exposure to dioxins and furans. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur. Rawn et al. (2012) published dioxin and furan data from pooled serum samples collected in cycle 1 of the CHMS. These previously published results were generated using a different statistical approach. As a result, they are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report.

Technical HBCD is typically composed of three isomers designated alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ). HBCD is produced synthetically. Technical products typically contain 10%–13% α-HBCD, 1%–12% β–HBCD and 75%–89% γ-HBCD (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011a; Heeb et al., 2005). The HBCD isomers measured in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) are listed in Table 8.1.1. Table 8.1.1 Hexabromocyclododecane isomers measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey cycles 1 (2007–2009), 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017) Compound name CASRN alpha-Hexabromocyclododecane (α-HBCD) 134237-50-6 beta-Hexabromocyclododecane (β-HBCD) 134237-51-7 gamma-Hexabromocyclododecane (γ-HBCD) 134237-52-8 Currently in Canada, the only known intentional use of HBCD is in products used in the automotive sector (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018a). However, HBCD may also be present in manufactured items, such as foam packaging made from recycled polystyrene and toys made from recycled plastics (Abdallah et al., 2018; DiGangi et al., 2017). Historically, HBCD use was primarily in polystyrene foam insulation in building and construction materials (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018a). To a lesser extent, it was also used as a flame retardant in textiles for upholstered furniture, transportation seating, wall coverings and draperies, as well as in adhesives, paints and electronics. HBCD does not occur naturally, but may enter the environment throughout its life cycle, from manufacturing through product use and disposal. In product applications, HBCD is mixed or dissolved rather than chemically bonded. As such, releases may occur in both indoor and outdoor environments. Due to its low vapour pressure and low water solubility, releases are expected to preferentially concentrate in household dust, soil and sediments rather than in air or water. HBCD has been detected in a wide array of environmental media, including air, water, soil and biota (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b). Once in the environment, HBCD is persistent and bioaccumulative, with half-lives of 2, 60 and 240 days in air, water and sediment respectively (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b; Schecter et al., 2012). Under some circumstances, such as adsorption to airborne particles, HBCD may be capable of undergoing long-range transport in the atmosphere (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b). HBCD has been detected in air, sediments, water and biota in remote places far from areas of use (NCP, 2013). Monitoring of ambient air and biota in Canada’s Arctic indicates that HBCD levels have generally increased since the 1990s (NCP, 2013; Rigét et al., 2019). The primary sources of exposure in the general population are food (including breast milk) and household dust (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b). HBCD exposure may also occur through air, water and certain consumer products; however, exposure from these sources is low. While technical HBCD is predominantly composed of the γ-isomer, the α-isomer is commonly the primary isomer measured in environmental media, household dust and food (Abdallah et al., 2008; Fromme et al., 2014; Rigét et al., 2019; Schecter et al., 2012). This shift to the α-isomer may be due to a combination of factors, including solubility, partitioning behaviour and uptake (Covaci et al., 2006). HBCD is expected to be readily absorbed following oral exposure (European Commission, 2008). Once absorbed, it can undergo stereoisomerization, hydroxylation and debromination in the liver. Studies in humans have demonstrated transplacental transfer of HBCD to developing fetuses. Studies in laboratory animals indicate that γ-HBCD and β-HBCD are more rapidly and extensively metabolized than α-HBCD (Erratico et al., 2016; Szabo et al., 2010; Szabo et al., 2011). α-HBCD has a greater potential to bioaccumulate due to its increased lipophilicity; biological samples generally contain α-HBCD as the predominant isomer (Rawn, Gaertner et al., 2014; Rawn, Ryan et al., 2014; Szabo et al., 2010; Szabo et al., 2011). HBCD isomers can be measured in human breast milk, adipose tissue and blood (EPA, 2010). Based upon studies in laboratory animals, elimination of HBCD is expected to occur mainly through feces and to a lesser degree through urine (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b). In humans, a half-life of 165 days has been estimated for α-HBCD, while a half-life of 55 days has been estimated for the β- and γ-isomers (Abdallah and Harrad, 2011). Since α-HBCD has a longer biological half-life than the other isomers, serum α-HBCD levels may indicate long-term exposure. Exposure to HBCD may result in adverse developmental and reproductive health effects, including altered behaviour and decreased fertility (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011b; European Commission, 2008; Health Canada, 2019). In addition, HBCD is a suspected endocrine disruptor, with effects observed on the thyroid hormone axis (Gannon, Moreau et al., 2019; Gannon, Nunnikhoven et al., 2019). There is no conclusive evidence for mutagenic or genotoxic effects (European Commission, 2008); consequently, HBCD is not classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (2020) or other agencies. HBCD is listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and is classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Canada, 1999; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018b; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, HBCD is targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2011a). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to prohibit the import, manufacture, use, sale and offer for sale of HBCD and products containing it, with a limited number of exceptions (Canada, 2012). Environment and Climate Change Canada (2018a) has proposed regulatory amendments to remove the exemptions on HBCD. Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to eliminate the import, export, production and use of HBCD through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Prior to the release of the CHMS data set, only limited data existed for HBCD blood levels in Canadians. In northern Canada, HBCD was measured in pooled serum from pregnant women (Ryan et al., 2005). This study included 10 pools of maternal serum from 560 individuals from Nunavut and the Northwest Territories sampled from 1994–1999. β- and γ-HBCD were not detected; α-HBCD was detected in three of the 10 pools, with concentrations of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 ng/g lipid. Three HBCD isomers (α, β and γ) were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1 (2007–2009) and aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of HBCD isomers in serum is an indicator of exposure to HBCD. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur. Rawn, Ryan et al. (2014) published HBCD data from pooled serum samples collected in cycle 1 of the CHMS. These previously published results were generated using a different statistical approach. As a result, they are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report.

There are 209 possible molecular combinations, or congeners, varying in the number of bromine atoms and their locations on the two rings. The PBDE congeners are named based on their structure, but are more commonly referred to by their International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) number. This approach systematically assigns numbers to the different congeners, with higher numbers assigned to those with a larger number of bromine atoms. Congeners are commonly classified into 10 groups designated as mono (one bromine atom) through deca (10 bromine atoms) (ATSDR, 2017). Table 8.2.1 lists the 23 PBDE congeners measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS).

Production of three commercial PBDE products (pentaBDE, octaBDE and decaBDE) began in the late 1970s (ATSDR, 2017). Each commercial product is a mixture of various congeners. Commercial pentaBDE is predominantly composed of tetraBDE, pentaBDE and hexaBDE congeners; commercial octaBDE is mainly composed of hexaBDE, heptaBDE and octaBDE; and commercial decaBDE is almost completely composed of decaBDE. The commercial products differ in composition, use, manufactured volume, toxicology and environmental distribution. In product applications, PBDEs are physically mixed rather than chemically bonded (ATSDR, 2017). These products were never manufactured in Canada. However, they have been imported as part of chemical formulations — such as resins, polymers or substrates that contain PBDEs — and in semi-finished or finished articles, such as computer housings, household appliances, furniture and automotive/aircraft seating and interiors, as well as in a variety of electrical and electronic components (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2016). The use of commercial pentaBDE and octaBDE mixtures has been phased out globally since 2006 and prohibited in Canada since 2008 (Environment Canada, 2010b; Health Canada, 2019). Export to Canada of the commercial decaBDE mixture manufactured in the United States ended in mid-2012, and there are currently no known Canadian users or importers (Health Canada, 2019). However, commercial decaBDE is still used in certain manufactured items imported into Canada, such as automotive parts and pallets (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018). In addition, PBDEs may be present in manufactured items made from recycled plastics containing PBDEs, including pens, shredders, staplers and wire spools (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2018). PBDEs do not generally occur naturally in the environment. However, other types of brominated diphenyl ethers (e.g. methoxylated PBDEs) have been found to occur naturally in marine environments (Teuten et al., 2005). Entry into the environment may occur throughout their life cycles — from handling and manufacturing through to product use and disposal. PBDEs in existing stock of in-use products continue to be a source of PBDEs in the environment. PBDEs have been detected in a wide array of environmental media, including air, water, soil and biota (ATSDR, 2017; EPA, 2010). Once in the environment, PBDEs are persistent, and most congeners are considered bioaccumulative (ATSDR, 2017). Half-lives vary by congener, with estimates ranging from less than a day in water to up to 50 years in sediment (ATSDR, 2017). Certain PBDEs also have the ability to undergo long-range transport in the atmosphere (Environment Canada, 2010b). They have been detected in air, sediments, water and biota in remote places far from areas of use (NCP, 2013). Monitoring of ambient air and biota in Canada’s Arctic indicates that levels of PBDEs generally increased from the 1990s until the early 2000s, but are now declining (NCP, 2013). The predominant routes of exposure to PBDEs in the general Canadian population are the ingestion of food (including breast milk) and the inhalation and ingestion of house dust (Health Canada, 2006; Health Canada, 2012). Other minor routes of exposure include inhalation from the off-gassing of furniture and electrical and electronic appliances into indoor air as well as dermal exposure through contact with PBDE-containing products, such as textiles and polymers (Health Canada, 2006; Health Canada, 2012). The specific PBDE congeners in food and house dust vary. Globally, PBDEs 47, 99 and 209 are the highest contributors to PBDE levels in food (Boucher et al., 2018). Dietary studies have demonstrated that fish and other aquatic foods generally have the highest levels of PBDEs, followed by meat and meat products (Boucher et al., 2018; Fromme et al., 2016). Studies conducted on house dust in Canada reported that among the PBDEs tested, the most abundant congeners were PBDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and 209 (Abbasi et al., 2016; Shoeib et al., 2012; Wilford et al., 2005). In children aged six months to four years, evidence suggests that mouthing of hard plastic toys may be an important route of exposure, with PBDE 209 as the main contributor (Chen, et al., 2009; Ionas et al., 2014). PBDEs are variably absorbed following oral exposure; lower-brominated congener groups, such as tetraBDE, pentaBDE and hexaBDE, are more likely than decaBDE to enter the body (ATSDR, 2017; EFSA, 2011). The extent of absorption following inhalation is unknown due to the paucity of evidence in humans and laboratory animals (ATSDR, 2017). Once absorbed, the higher brominated PBDEs undergo debromination to form lower-brominated congeners (ATSDR, 2017; Health Canada, 2012). The lower-brominated PBDEs are persistent and accumulate preferentially in adipose tissue. Studies in humans have demonstrated transplacental transfer of PBDEs to developing fetuses. PBDEs have been measured in human adipose tissue, serum and breast milk (ATSDR, 2017). Elimination of PBDEs from the body occurs mainly through the feces, with a very small amount eliminated in urine (ATSDR, 2017). Higher brominated congeners tend to have shorter half-lives than lower-brominated congeners; apparent half-lives for PBDE congeners in blood have been observed to range from 15 days for decaBDE to as high as 94 days for octaBDE congeners (ATSDR, 2017). The presence of a lower-brominated congener in the body may reflect environmental exposure, either to that congener or to a higher brominated PBDE that has undergone debromination. The predominant congeners identified in breast milk and other human tissues are PBDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and 154 (McDonald, 2005). Based on studies in laboratory animals and humans, the primary targets of PBDE toxicity appear to be the developing nervous and reproductive systems, the endocrine system, the liver and the male reproductive system (ATSDR, 2017). Epidemiological studies in humans have demonstrated correlations between PBDE exposures and various neurodevelopmental effects, including attention problems and impaired fine motor coordination (ATSDR, 2017). Data from humans and animals suggest that PBDEs, especially lower-brominated PBDEs, can interact with thyroid hormone homeostasis and male reproductive systems; animal studies have indicated the potential for hepatotoxicity (ATSDR, 2017). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1990, 2019) has classified decaBDE as Group 3 (not classifiable as to their carcinogenicity to humans). The carcinogenicities of lower-brominated PBDE congeners have not been evaluated. PBDEs — specifically tetraBDE, pentaBDE, hexaBDE, heptaBDE, octaBDE, nonaBDE and decaBDE congeners — are listed in Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and are classified as persistent organic pollutants by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Canada, 1999; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2016; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers these PBDE congeners to be persistent; however, only tetraBDE, pentaBDE and hexaBDEs are considered bioaccumulative (Canada, 2000; Environment Canada, 2006). As such, tetraBDE, pentaBDE and hexaBDEs are targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substances) (Environment Canada, 2010a). CEPA 1999 risk management actions have been developed to prohibit the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and import of PBDEs, with an exemption for manufactured items (Canada, 2012). Environment and Climate Change Canada (2018) has proposed regulatory amendments to remove the exemptions (except for decaBDE). PBDEs have also been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to eliminate the import, export, production and use of PBDEs through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. PBDEs have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools, and the highest concentrations were measured for PBDEs 47 and 99. Mean concentrations ranged from 11–340 ng/g lipid for PBDE 47 and from 2.5–470 ng/g lipid for PBDE 99. Another study, the Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study, was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. As with the other regional biomonitoring studies, PBDE 47 was the most highly detected, with concentrations ranging from 7.3–29 ng/g lipid. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for eight PBDEs (PBDEs 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183 and 209). The highest concentration was measured for PBDE 47, with a geometric mean of 15.33 ng/g lipid. PBDEs have also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the CHMS and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. During cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the CHMS, the geometric mean PBDE 47 level in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 was 10.04 ng/g lipid (Health Canada, 2010). Geometric means were not calculated for the remaining PBDEs (PBDEs 15, 17, 25, 28, 33, 99, 100 and 153) due to low detection levels. Higher plasma levels of PBDE 47 and PBDE 100 were associated with an increased prevalence of hypothyroidism in adult women aged 30–79 in cycle 1 of the CHMS (Oulhote et al., 2016). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation has been surveyed as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The study comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada with 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. In 2011, the geometric mean for PBDE 47 in blood plasma was 6.40 ng/g lipid. As with the CHMS, geometric means were not calculated for additional PBDEs included in the FNBI due to low detection levels. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 years and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). There were 1,983 participants. Among them, 1,928 had available samples for PBDE analysis in their first trimester of pregnancy. The geometric mean concentration in maternal blood plasma was 7.02 ng/g lipid for PBDE 47; it was not calculated for the remaining PBDEs (PBDEs 28, 33, 99, 100 and 153) due to low detection levels (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of PBDEs in 3,083 Inuit participants from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for PBDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and 209 in plasma for participants aged 18 years and older ranged from below the limit of detection to 28 ng/g lipid, with the highest concentrations measured for PBDEs 47 and 209. Twenty-three PBDE congeners (Table 8.2.1) were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1.Five PBDE congeners — PBDEs 47, 99, 100, 153 and 209 — were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of PBDE congeners in serum is an indicator of exposure to PBDEs. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur. Rawn et al. (2014) published PBDE data from pooled serum samples collected in cycle 1 of the CHMS. These previously published results were generated using a different statistical approach. As a result, they are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report.

Environmental Science and Technology, 39(18), 7027–7035. 8.3 Tetrabromobisphenol A Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA; CASRN 79-94-7) is a brominated flame retardant used in plastics and resins. It is an industrial chemical produced by reacting bromine with bisphenol A. Commercial formulations typically contain around 98% TBBPA (European Chemicals Bureau, 2006). While TBBPA is not known to be manufactured in Canada, it is imported for use as a flame retardant (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). It is primarily used as a reactive flame retardant in epoxy and polycarbonate resins found in printed circuit boards, with a variety of end-use markets that include computers and automotive and consumer electronics (Covaci et al., 2009; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Flame retardant epoxy resins are also used in glass-reinforced construction panels, motor housings and terminal boards. Flame retardant polycarbonate resins have applications in communications and electronics equipment, appliances, transportation devices, sports and recreation equipment, lighting fixtures and signs (WHO, 1995). TBBPA is also used as a reactive flame retardant in unsaturated polyester resins, which are used to make simulated marble floor tiles, furniture parts, coupling compounds for sewer pipes, and automotive patching compounds, and to encapsulate electrical devices (WHO, 1995). TBBPA is also used as an additive flame retardant in the manufacture of acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene resins and phenolic resins and in the production of TBBPA derivatives and oligomers (Covaci et al., 2009; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). TBBPA does not occur naturally in the environment. Entry into the environment may occur throughout its life cycle, from manufacture through processing, use and disposal of the substance or products containing it (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Releases from product applications may occur from volatilization or leaching, particularly when TBBPA is used as an additive flame retardant. TBBPA has been detected in a wide array of environmental media, including air, dust, water and soil (IARC, 2018). Once in the environment, TBBPA is considered persistent but not bioaccumulative (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Under anaerobic conditions, TBBPA can be microbially transformed to bisphenol A. Half-lives for TBBPA in the environment range from 44–179 days in soil, 48–84 days in water and 1–9 days in air (NTP, 2002). TBBPA has been detected in remote Arctic regions. This suggests it may be capable of undergoing long-range transport (de Wit et al., 2010, Vorkamp et al., 2019). Known sources of exposure to TBBPA in the general Canadian population are the ingestion of foods (including human breast milk) and the ingestion and inhalation of household dust (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Additional exposure may also result from environmental sources, such as ambient air, indoor air and drinking water. Consumer exposure to TBBPA directly from product use is likely to be negligible (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013; European Chemicals Bureau, 2006). Absorption of TBBPA is expected to occur readily following oral exposure, but is limited following inhalation (European Chemicals Bureau, 2006; Knudsen et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017). Studies in laboratory animals have reported that once TBBPA is absorbed, there is limited distribution and rapid excretion, which suggests that it does not bioaccumulate (European Chemicals Bureau, 2006). A study in laboratory animals demonstrated no significant transfer of TBBPA to developing fetuses ((Meerts et al. 1999, cited in Environment Canada and Health Canada 2013). TBBPA has been measured in human blood, breast milk and adipose tissue (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Based on studies in laboratory animals, elimination of TBBPA is expected to occur mainly through feces (Kuester et al. 2007; Yu et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2017). In humans, a half-life of approximately two days has been estimated for TBBPA; levels in blood reflect recent exposures (Hagmar et al., 2000). Human toxicity data are not available for TBBPA exposure, and only limited information from animal studies exists (Wikoff et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019). Initial assessments of available animal toxicity data did not identify any health effects of concern on the basis of a lack of reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, genotoxicity and mutagenicity in laboratory studies (CONTAM, 2011; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013; European Chemicals Bureau, 2006). However, some recent studies in laboratory animals have suggested that TBBPA exposure may disrupt the endocrine system, thyroid hormones and neuro-behavioural functions (Wikoff et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2019). A set of carcinogenicity studies in laboratory animals demonstrated a novel association between TBBPA exposure and increased incidence of uterine epithelial tumours (NTP, 2014). More recently, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in laboratory animals, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (2018) classified TBBPA as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A). In a screening assessment under the Chemicals Management Plan, the Government of Canada concluded that TBBPA is persistent but not bioaccumulative, and does not present a risk to the environment or human health as per the criteria set out in section 64 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) (Canada, 1999; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). Based upon the screening assessment, exposure in Canada to TBBPA is currently limited. However, there may be concerns if new activities were to occur that resulted in increased exposure in Canada. The Government of Canada has indicated that it will investigate how best to monitor changes in the use of TBBPA so that it is notified of any new activities pertaining to its use, manufacture or import and can assess the activities for ecological and human health risks (Environment Canada and Health Canada, 2013). There are no existing Canadian risk management measures that are specific to controlling the use of TBBPA or its release into the environment (Environment Canada, 2013). Prior to the release of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) data set, only limited data existed for TBBPA blood levels in Canadians. In 2004 in northern Canada, a large-scale health survey was conducted among permanent Inuit residents of Nunavik aged 18 and older (Dallaire et al., 2009). TBBPA was detected in a small portion (5%) of the 771 plasma samples analyzed, with concentrations ranging from less than the limit of detection (LOD) (10 ng/L) to 82.6 ng/g lipid (480 ng/L). In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study of pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were pooled. TBBPA concentrations were less than the LOD (<0.03 ng/g lipid) in all 158 pools analyzed. TBBPA was also analyzed in the pooled serum samples of participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017) of the CHMS. Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of TBBPA in serum is an indicator of exposure to TBBPA. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur.

Environmental Pollution, 253, 909–917. 9 Summaries and results for organochlorine pesticides 9.1 Chlordane Chlordane is an organochlorine pesticide that was introduced in the 1940s as a broad-based insecticide for use on a variety of agricultural crops, for residential applications (such as lawns and gardens), as a fumigating agent, and for underground application to homes as termite prevention (ATSDR, 2018). In Canada, chlordane was first registered for use in 1939. While it was never manufactured in Canada, its use continued until 1990 (CCME, 1999; CEC 2001). The production, sale and use of chlordane in the United States have been prohibited since 1988 (ATSDR, 2018). Technical chlordane is a mixture of more than 140 structurally related organochlorine compounds. The most abundant components are α-chlordane, γ-chlordane, chlordene, heptachlor, trans-nonachlor and cis-nonachlor (ATSDR, 2018). The chlordane-related chemicals measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) are listed in Table 9.1.1. Table 9.1.1 Chlordane-related chemicals measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey Compound name CASRN Cycle 1 (2007–2009) Cycle 3 (2012–2013) Cycle 4 (2014–2015) Cycle 5 (2016–2017) trans-Nonachlor 39765-80-5 Yes Yes Yes Yes Oxychlordane 27304-13-8 No Yes Yes Yes Chlordane is a synthetic chemical mixture with no natural sources. Releases to the environment are solely the result of anthropogenic activities. Chlordane has been detected in all environmental media. While its use has been discontinued in Canada, chlordane compounds are very resistant to degradation, with estimated half-lives in soil of up to 10 years (Hornsby et al., 1996). Chlordane has the potential for long-range transport and the potential to bioaccumulate in many organisms (ATSDR, 2018). Monitoring of ambient air and biota from Canada’s Arctic indicates that levels of chlordane, along with those of many legacy persistent organic pollutants, declined from 1993–2009 (NCP, 2013). The primary route of exposure for the general population is expected to be the ingestion of foods containing trace amounts of chlordane, although individuals living in homes treated with chlordane to control termites may be exposed to elevated indoor air concentrations (ATSDR, 2018). Chlordane can remain for decades in soils where it was previously applied; food products grown in these soils continued to show detectable concentrations long after its use was discontinued in Canada (Incorvia Mattina et al., 2000). Chlordane exposure may also occur through inhalation or drinking water; however, concentrations in ambient air and water are generally very low (WHO, 2004). Chlordane can be absorbed following ingestion. Once it has been absorbed, metabolism results in a number of oxidation products, including oxychlordane (ATSDR, 2018). Chlordane and its metabolites concentrate in adipose tissue and can be measured in human blood, urine, feces and breast milk (ATSDR, 2018). Biological samples tend to contain primarily oxychlordane and nonachlor compounds (Donaldson et al., 2010; Health Canada, 2010). Elimination of these chemicals from the body occurs over months to years, mostly through feces; breast milk is a major excretion route in lactating women (CDC, 2017). Since chlordane and its metabolites are retained in the body for long periods of time and are only slowly excreted, their presence can indicate long-term exposure. Chlordane toxicity is characterized by neurological, hepatic, developmental and hematological effects (ATSDR, 2018). In humans, exposure to high levels of chlordane through its former use as a pesticide and following ingestion of chlordane-containing substances has resulted in neurotoxic effects, including migraines, convulsions and seizures (ATSDR, 2018). In animals, hepatic, developmental and hematological effects include increased liver weight, impaired neurobehavioural development and, in some studies, increased leukocyte counts (ATSDR, 2018). At environmental concentrations, initial studies in humans have demonstrated associations between chlordane components and metabolites in serum and total diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) and prediabetes (ATSDR, 2018). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (2001) has classified chlordane as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) based on inadequate evidence in humans and sufficient evidence in laboratory animals, specifically liver cancer observed in some animal studies. Chlordane has been classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention (UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity (Health Canada, 1999; Environment Canada, 2008). As chlordane is no longer in use in Canada, the Government of Canada concluded that no further actions are required under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999), provided that chlordane is not manufactured, imported or used in Canada in quantities greater than 100 kg/year (Canada, 1999; Environment Canada, 2008). The production, sale or use of chlordane in Canada constitutes a violation of the Pest Control Products Act (Canada, 2002). The Pest Management Regulatory Agency has established maximum residue limits, regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, for chlordane in food (Health Canada, 2012). Chlordane has also been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to restrict the import, production and use of chlordane through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. trans-Nonachlor and oxychlordane have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools; trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane concentrations were all below the limits of detection (LODs). Another study, the Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study, was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools; as with the Alberta study, trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane concentrations were below the LODs. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane, with geometric means of 57.82 ng/g lipid and 32.96 ng/g lipid, respectively. Chlordane components and the metabolite oxychlordane have also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the CHMS and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. During cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the CHMS, the geometric mean trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane levels in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 were 5.98 ng/g lipid and 4.21 ng/g lipid, respectively (Health Canada, 2010). The CHMS also measured the chlordane components α-chlordane, γ-chlordane and cis-nonachlor in individual plasma samples in cycle 1; however, geometric mean concentrations were not calculated due to low detection levels (Health Canada, 2010). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation has been surveyed as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The survey comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada and included 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. In 2011, the geometric means for trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane in blood plasma were 4.13 ng/g lipid and 2.45 ng/g lipid, respectively. α-Chlordane, γ-chlordane and cis-nonachlor were also measured in cycle 1 of the CHMS and the FNBI; however, geometric means were not calculated due to low detection levels. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 years and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). There were 1,935 participants with first-trimester blood plasma for organochlorine analysis. The geometric mean concentration was 2.90 ng/g lipid for trans-nonachlor and 2.01 ng/g lipid for oxychlordane; it was not calculated for cis-nonachlor due to low detection levels (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane in 3,083 Inuit participants (men and women) from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for trans-nonachlor and oxychlordane in plasma for Inuit men and women (18 years and older) ranged from 14–170 ng/g lipid and from 8.0–100 ng/g lipid, respectively. Continuous monitoring among communities in Nunavik indicates that geometric means of persistent organic pollutants, including oxychlordane and trans-nonachlor and its metabolites, have declined since 1992 (NCP, 2018). trans-Nonachlor was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1 and 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). Oxychlordane was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3, cycle 4 and cycle 5. Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of chlordane components or metabolites in serum is an indicator of exposure to chlordane. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur.

First registered for use in Canada in 1946, it was used to control forestry, agricultural and domestic insect pests (ATSDR, 2019; Environment Canada, 2006). While it was never manufactured in Canada, its import continued until the mid-1970s (Environment Canada, 2006). At this time, most uses of DDT in Canada were phased out due to increasing environmental and human health concerns (Environment Canada, 2013). Registration of all uses in Canada ended in 1985, with the expectation that all remaining stocks would be sold, used or disposed of by the end of 1990 in accordance with the Pest Control Products Act (Environment Canada, 2006). DDT remains in use in some countries, primarily in Africa, to fight malaria (WHO, 2009). Technical-grade DDT is composed of up to 14 compounds, with the active ingredient, p,p'-DDT, making up 65%–80% (Metcalf, 1995). The DDT compound and metabolites measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) are listed in Table 9.2.1. Table 9.2.1 Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey Compound name CASRN Cycle 1 (2007–2009) Cycle 3 (2012–2013) Cycle 4 (2014–2015) Cycle 5 (2016–2017) o,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (o,p'-DDE) 3424-82-6 No Yes Yes Yes p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) 72-55-9 Yes Yes Yes Yes p,p'-Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p'-DDT) 50-29-3 Yes No No No DDT does not occur naturally in the environment. However, it has been applied directly to soil and has entered surface water bodies due to pest control near water (CCME, 1999). Even though DDT is not currently used in Canada, residues of concern from historical use remain due to their persistence in the environment. DDT degrades very slowly in the environment, with a half-life in soil of 2–15 years, depending on conditions (CDC, 2017; NCP, 2013). In the environment, DDT is transformed into more stable chemical forms, including DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) and DDD (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane). Due to its semi-volatile properties, DDT can reach polar regions through long-range atmospheric transport. The microbial–protozoal–fish–seal–polar bear–human food web serves as a conduit, introducing DDT into the Arctic marine ecosystem and increasing local human exposure (Risebrough et al., 1976; Van Oostdam et al., 2005). Monitoring of ambient air and biota in Canada’s Arctic indicates that levels of DDT declined from 1993–2009 along with those of many legacy persistent organic pollutants (NCP, 2013). The primary route of exposure to DDT for the general population is expected to be the ingestion of foods — particularly meat, fish, poultry and dairy products — that contain residues of DDT or its degradation products (ATSDR, 2019; Kosatsky et al., 1999). The transport characteristics of DDT and its metabolites lead to their deposition in northern latitudes, which make northern populations in Canada more susceptible to exposure, especially Inuit who eat more country foods (including fish, seal and whales). Foods imported into Canada from other countries that still use DDT may contain residues of DDT or its metabolites; as such, they may also potentially be a source of continued exposure (ATSDR, 2019). DDT exposure from inhalation does not contribute significantly to body burden. Drinking water is considered a negligible source of exposure due to DDT’s low solubility in water (ATSDR, 2019). DDT can be absorbed following ingestion and is metabolized in the liver to DDE and DDD. DDT and its metabolites are distributed throughout the body via the lymph and blood and concentrate in adipose tissue (ATSDR, 2019). o,p’-DDE, p,p’-DDE and p,p’-DDT have been measured in whole blood, plasma and serum. Excretion of DDT in the form of its metabolites occurs mainly in the urine, although it may also occur through feces, semen and breast milk (ATSDR, 2019). p,p′-DDT and p,p’-DDE have been estimated to have whole-body half-lives of two years and six years, respectively (Ritter et al., 2009). As DDE has a longer biological half-life than DDT, serum DDE levels may indicate long-term exposure (ATSDR, 2019). The best-known effects of DDT and its metabolites are on the nervous system. It impairs nerve impulse conduction. At high levels of exposure, tremors and convulsions have been observed in both humans and laboratory animals (ATSDR, 2019). In animals, DDT exposure is associated with marked alteration of reproduction and development. These effects are attributed to the hormone-altering effects of DDT and its metabolites (ATSDR, 2019). However, in humans, effects from DDT at low environmental levels are unknown, and there is no conclusive evidence of altered reproduction and development (ATSDR, 2019). The potential role of DDT and its metabolites in the prevalence of obesity has recently been reviewed and is under ongoing investigation (Cano-Sancho et al., 2017). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (2018) has classified DDT as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group 2A) based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals, limited evidence in humans and strong mechanistic evidence. DDT is listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and is classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Canada, 1999; Environment Canada, 2013; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, DDT is targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Canada, 1998). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to prohibit the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and import of DDT and products containing it (Canada, 2012). DDT is also included under the trade name Clofenotane as a prohibited ingredient on the List of Prohibited and Restricted Cosmetic Ingredients (more commonly referred to as the Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist, or simply the Hotlist), an administrative tool that Health Canada uses to communicate to manufacturers and others that certain substances, when present in a cosmetic, may not comply with requirements of the Food and Drugs Act or the Cosmetic Regulations (Health Canada, 2019). In addition, the sale or use of DDT in Canada today constitutes a violation of the Pest Control Products Act (Canada, 2002; Environment Canada, 2013). The Pest Management Regulatory Agency has established maximum residue limits, regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, for DDT in food (Health Canada, 2012). p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE have also been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to restrict the import, production and use of DDT through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Stockholm Convention (Environment Canada, 2013). DDT and its metabolites have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools; p,p'-DDE concentrations ranged from 12–214 ng/g lipid. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools; p,p'-DDE concentrations ranged from 19–140 ng/g lipid. p,p'-DDT was also measured in these studies; however, concentrations were not calculated due to low detection levels. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for p,p'-DDE, with a geometric mean of 169.55 ng/g lipid. DDT and its metabolites have also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the CHMS and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. During cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the CHMS, the geometric mean p,p'-DDE level in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 was 152.05 ng/g lipid (Health Canada, 2010). Plasma DDE was found to be negatively associated with lung function parameters based on measurements collected in cycle 1 (Ye et al., 2015). In addition, p,p'-DDE concentrations were observed to increase with age and were higher in females than in males (Singh et al., 2019; Ye et al., 2015). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation has been surveyed as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The study comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada with 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. In 2011, the geometric mean for p,p'-DDE in blood plasma was 77.09 ng/g lipid. p,p'-DDT was also measured in cycle 1 of the CHMS and the FNBI; however, geometric means were not calculated due to low detection levels. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). There were 1,935 participants with first-trimester blood plasma samples available for organochlorine analysis. The geometric mean concentration in maternal blood plasma was 56.02 ng/g lipid for DDE; it was not calculated for p,p’-DDT due to low detection levels (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in 3,083 Inuit participants from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE in plasma for Inuit men and women (18 years and older) ranged from 4.2–16 ng/g lipid and from 150–470 ng/g lipid, respectively. Continuous monitoring of communities in Nunavik indicates that geometric means of persistent organic pollutants, including DDT and its metabolites, have declined since 1992 (NCP, 2018). p,p'-DDT was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1. p,p'-DDE was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1 and 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). o,p'-DDE was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3, cycle 4 and cycle 5. Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of DDT or its metabolites in serum is an indicator of exposure to DDT. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur.

Environmental Health Perspectives, 123(5), 422–427. 9.3 Endosulfan Endosulfan (CASRN 115-29-7) is an organochlorine insecticide and acaracide. Beginning in the 1950s, it was used in Canada to control a broad range of insect and arthropod pests on a wide variety of food, feed and ornamental crops (Health Canada, 2011). Due to increasing environmental and human health concerns, registration of all endosulfan pesticide products in Canada ended on December 31, 2016 (Health Canada, 2010; Health Canada, 2011; Health Canada, 2017). Technical-grade endosulfan is a mixture of two biologically active isomers (α- and β-), with the α-isomer and β-isomer contributing about 70% and 30%, respectively, along with minor impurities and degradation products (UNEP, 2010). The two endosulfan isomers measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) are listed in Table 9.3.1. Table 9.3.1 Endosulfan isomers measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017) Compound name CASRN α-Endosulfan (endosulfan I) 959-98-8 β-Endosulfan (endosulfan II) 33213-65-9 Endosulfan does not occur naturally in the environment. It enters the environment following agricultural and residential applications (ATSDR, 2015). Even though it is no longer in use in Canada, it is persistent in the atmosphere, sediments and water; residues of concern from historical use may remain. It degrades slowly in the environment, with estimated atmospheric half-lives in the range of 9–13 years (Shunthirasingham et al., 2016). Endosulfan also bioaccumulates and has the potential for long-range transport (UNEP, 2010). It has been detected in air, sediments, water and biota in remote regions far from areas of use (Hung et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2016; Shunthirasingham et al., 2016; Weber et al., 2010). Monitoring of air, water and biota in Canada’s Arctic indicates that levels of endosulfan were steady from 1993–2001, then declined from 2006–2009 (NCP, 2013). Due to its previous use in agriculture and tobacco farming, exposure of the general population to endosulfan was primarily through the ingestion of food and use of tobacco products (ATSDR, 2015; WHO, 2004). Due to its ability to bioaccumulate, food is likely still a current source of exposure, although levels in food are generally considered low (ATSDR, 2015). Endosulfan exposure may also occur through inhalation or drinking water; however, concentrations in ambient air and water are generally very low (WHO, 2004). Endosulfan is rapidly absorbed following ingestion of contaminated food, but there is no available information on the rate of absorption following exposure through air or drinking water (ATSDR, 2015). Once absorbed, endosulfan is metabolized into endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan diol. These can be further broken down into lactone, hydroxyether and ether metabolites (ATSDR, 2015). Endosulfan and its metabolites have been measured in blood, urine, adipose tissues and breast milk. Elimination occurs mainly through the feces and to a lesser extent through urine (ATSDR, 2015). Endosulfan is not expected to accumulate significantly in human tissues. It has an estimated elimination half-life of 1–7 days (ATSDR, 2015). Levels of endosulfan in blood and urine reflect recent exposure (ATSDR, 2015). The main target of endosulfan toxicity in humans and animals — as with other organochlorine pesticides — is the nervous system. Endosulfan impairs neurotransmission; tremors, seizures and deaths have been observed in humans at high levels of exposure (ATSDR, 2015). In animals, studies characterizing the potential risk from short- and longer-term exposure to endosulfan have reported effects on the kidneys (ATSDR, 2015; WHO, 2004). Endosulfan exposure has been associated with adverse reproductive effects in some animal studies. However, in humans, effects from endosulfan at low environmental levels are unknown, and there is no conclusive evidence of altered reproduction or development (ATSDR, 2015). Endosulfan is considered genotoxic, but not oncogenic; the International Agency for Research on Cancer has not classified endosulfan in terms of its ability to cause cancer (ATSDR, 2015; Silva and Beauvais, 2010). Endosulfan has been classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, endosulfan is targeted in Canada for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Health Canada, 2010). As it is no longer registered for use in Canada, its production, sale or use constitutes a violation of the Pest Control Products Act (Canada, 2002). The Pest Management Regulatory Agency has established maximum residue limits, regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, for endosulfan in food (Health Canada, 2012). The α- and β-endosulfan isomers have been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to restrict the import, production and use of endosulfan through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Stockholm Convention. Endosulfan isomers have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools. Levels of α- and β-endosulfan were below the limits of detection (LODs) in all pools. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. As with the other regional biomonitoring studies, β-endosulfan levels were below the LODs (7.4–15 ng/g lipid) for all pools (α-endosulfan was not measured). In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed. The levels of α- and β-endosulfan were reported to be below the LODs in all pools. α- and β-endosulfan were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). Data from these cycles are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of α- or β-endosulfan in serum is an indicator of exposure to endosulfan. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur.

HCB has been used in several products, including pesticides, fireworks, ammunition, synthetic rubber, wood preservative and dielectric fluids, and as an aluminum fluxing agent (ATSDR, 2015; Aulagnier and Poissant, 2005; CCME, 1999). Its primary application in Canada was as a fungicide treatment for grain seeds, which began in the 1940s and continued until the 1970s (ATSDR, 2015). HCB has not been used commercially in Canada since 1972 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017), is no longer used commercially in the United States, and has not been produced in North America since the late 1970s (ATSDR, 2015). HCB does not occur naturally in the environment. Even though HCB is no longer in use in Canada, it can be released to the environment through the manufacture and use of chlorinated solvents and pesticides that contain HCB impurities; through long-range transport and deposition from contaminated areas; and through industrial and incineration emissions that produce HCB through incomplete combustion (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). HCB is persistent in the environment, with a calculated global atmospheric half-life of 1.69 years. It is found in a wide range of environmental media in Canada (ATSDR, 2015; Brubaker and Hites, 1998; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 1993). HCB also bioaccumulates and undergoes long-range transport in the atmosphere (ATSDR, 2015). It has been detected in ambient air, sediments, water and biota in remote regions far from areas of use (Hung et al., 2010; NCP, 2013) Exposure of the general population to HCB is primarily through the ingestion of food grown in soil contaminated with HCB or the ingestion of animal tissue containing accumulated HCB, especially foods with high lipid contents (ATSDR, 2015; Environment Canada and Health Canada, 1993). Exposure may also occur through contact with contaminated air or drinking water, although these exposures tend to be much lower than food exposures. Following the ingestion of contaminated food, HCB is absorbed and rapidly distributed throughout the body (ATSDR, 2015). Tissue distribution appears to be governed by HCB’s lipophilicity and the relative fat content of tissues, with bioaccumulation occurring primarily in adipose tissue (ATSDR, 2015; Lu et al., 2006). HCB is metabolized slowly in the liver and conjugated with glutathione (ATSDR, 2015). Pentachlorophenol is a major metabolite; 2,4,5-trichlorophenol is a minor one. HCB and its metabolites have been measured in blood, urine and feces (ATSDR, 2015). In general, fecal excretion of unchanged HCB is the major pathway of elimination, with minor proportions excreted as metabolites in urine and feces (ATSDR, 2015). HCB has been estimated to have a whole-body half-life of 17 years (Bu et al., 2015). Since HCB is retained for long periods of time, measurement of HCB and its metabolites can indicate long-term exposure (ATSDR, 2015). The primary targets of HCB toxicity in humans and animals are the liver, ovary, thyroid and central nervous system. Exposures in humans to high levels following accidental poisoning have resulted in liver disease, higher death rates in young children, as well as skin lesions, hyperpigmentation, hirsutism, colic, weakness, enlarged thyroid and porphyrinuria (ATSDR, 2015). In animals, studies characterizing the risks of long-term ingestion of large amounts of HCB have reported damage to the liver, kidney and thyroid (including tumours in each of these organs), as well as damage to the nervous system (ATSDR, 2015). HCB exposure has been associated with adverse reproductive effects in animal studies. However, in humans, there is no conclusive evidence of altered reproduction (ATSDR, 2015). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (2001) has classified HCB as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals and inadequate evidence in humans. HCB is listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and is classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Canada, 1999; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, HCB is targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Canada, 1998). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to prohibit the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and import of HCB and products containing it (Canada, 2012). HCB has been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to prohibit the production, use, import and export of HCB worldwide through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Stockholm Convention (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). HCB has been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools. HCB concentrations ranged from 22–65 ng/g lipid. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. HCB concentrations ranged from 7.5–71 ng/g lipid. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for HCB, with a geometric mean of 27.37 ng/g lipid. HCB has also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. During cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the survey, the geometric mean HCB level in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 was 9.09 ng/g lipid (Health Canada, 2010). The CHMS also measured the non-specific HCB metabolites pentachlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol in individual urine samples of participants aged 3–79 in cycle 2 (2009–2011) (Health Canada, 2013). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation has been surveyed as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The study comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada with 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. In 2011, the 95th percentile for HCB in blood plasma was 18.21 ng/g lipid, while the geometric mean was not calculated due to low detection levels. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). There were 1,934 participants with first-trimester blood plasma samples available for HCB analysis. The 95th percentile in maternal blood plasma was 11.73 ng/g lipid for HCB; the geometric mean was not calculated due to low detection levels (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of HCB in 3,083 Inuit participants from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for HCB in plasma of Inuit men and women (18 years and older) ranged from 21–100 ng/g lipid. Continuous monitoring among communities in Nunavik indicates that geometric means of HCB have declined since 1992 (NCP, 2018). HCB was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1, and 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017).

In Canada, mirex was never registered for use as a pesticide, nor was it used as an industrial chemical (Environment Canada, 2006). Mirex was used as an insecticide, primarily against ant and termite species, in the United States, South Africa and certain South America countries (ATSDR, 2019). It was also marketed as a flame retardant in the United States, and was added to plastics, rubber, paint, paper and electrical goods from 1959–1972. All registered products containing mirex were cancelled in the United States from 1977–1978 (ATSDR, 2019). Technical-grade mirex contained 95% mirex and a small amount of chlordecone. Mirex is also known under the trade names CG-1283, dechlorane, HRS1276b and ENT 25719 (ATSDR, 2019). Mirex does not occur naturally in the environment. Although it was not used in Canada, it has entered the Canadian environment via long-range atmospheric transport and via water and sediments from chemical manufacturing and flame retardant production near the Niagara and Oswego rivers in the United States (Environment Canada, 2013). Mirex is very persistent in the environment and highly resistant to degradation. It binds strongly to soil, with a half-life of 12 years (ATSDR, 2019). Releases to the Niagara and Oswego rivers resulted in the contamination of Lake Ontario. Due to the cancellation of uses in the United States and other jurisdictions, concentrations of mirex in Lake Ontario fish have been decreasing since the 1980s (Gandhi et al., 2015). As the result of long-range atmospheric transport, mirex has been detected in biota in the Canadian Arctic (NCP, 2013). Monitoring of biota from Canada’s Arctic over nearly three decades has shown both significantly increasing and decreasing trends, depending on the specific study and species (Rigét et al., 2010). The primary route of exposure to mirex for the general population is the ingestion of food (ATSDR, 2019). In the past, the highest concentrations of mirex were found in fish from the Great Lakes region (ATSDR, 2019). The transport characteristics of mirex make northern populations in Canada, especially Inuit who eat more country foods (including fish, seal and whales), more susceptible to exposure. Minimal exposure to mirex is expected to result from drinking water or breathing due to its low water solubility and involatility (ATSDR, 2009). Mirex can be absorbed into the body following ingestion. Unabsorbed mirex is excreted unchanged through feces within 48 hours. Once absorbed, mirex does not undergo metabolism. Rather, it is distributed to various tissues, and concentrates in adipose tissue (ATSDR, 2019); it is commonly measured in human milk and adipose tissue. Excretion of absorbed mirex is negligible through urine and occurs very slowly through feces, with estimated half-lives of more than a year in laboratory animals (ATSDR, 2019). Excretion may also occur through breast milk. Since mirex is retained in the body for long periods of time and only slowly excreted, its measurement can be a useful indicator of long-term exposure (ATSDR, 2019). Data on the health effects of mirex in humans are limited to epidemiological studies assessing associations between blood concentrations and selected health outcomes. These studies have demonstrated associations with reproductive health and developmental outcomes, including menopause, cognitive development and male reproductive hormones. However, there is no strong evidence of increased diabetes risk (ATSDR, 2019). In laboratory animals, the liver, kidney, thyroid and several reproductive and developmental end points are the primary targets for mirex toxicity (ATSDR, 2019). Reported developmental toxicity outcomes include cardiac dysrhythmias and cataracts, while reproductive toxicity outcomes include decreased fertility and effects on reproductive organs, such as testicular atrophy. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1987) has classified mirex as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) based on the absence of adequate human data and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals. Mirex is listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and is classified as a persistent organic pollutant by the Stockholm Convention (Canada, 1999; Environment Canada, 2013; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers it to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, mirex is targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Canada, 1998). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to prohibit the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale and import of mirex and products containing it (Canada, 2012). Internationally, Canada is working with the United Nations to restrict the import, production and use of mirex through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Environment Canada, 2013). Mirex has been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools. Mirex concentrations ranged from 22–166 ng/g lipid. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 among pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. Mirex concentrations were below the limits of detection (7.4–15 ng/g lipid) for all. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for mirex, with a geometric mean of 4.64 ng/g lipid. Mirex has also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. During cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the CHMS, the 95th percentile mirex level in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 was 9.08 ng/g lipid; the geometric mean was not calculated due to low detection levels (Health Canada, 2010). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation has been surveyed as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The study comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada with 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. In 2011, the 95th percentile for mirex in blood plasma was 27.51 ng/g lipid, while the geometric mean was not calculated due to low detection levels. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 years and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). There were 1,935 participants with first-trimester blood plasma samples available for analysis. The 95th percentile in maternal blood plasma was 2.50 ng/g lipid; the geometric mean was not calculated due to low detection levels (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of mirex for 3,083 Inuit participants from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for mirex in plasma among Inuit men and women (18 years and older) ranged from 3.3–16 ng/g lipid. Continuous monitoring among communities in Nunavik indicates that geometric means of persistent organic pollutants, including mirex, have declined since 1992 (NCP, 2018). Mirex was analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1. Data are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of mirex in serum is an indicator of exposure to mirex. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur.

There are 209 possible chemicals (called congeners) within the PCB group. They vary in the number of chlorine atoms and their locations on the two benzene rings. The PCB congeners are named based on their structures, but are more commonly referred to by their International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) numbers. This approach systematically assigns numbers to the different congeners, with higher numbers assigned to congeners with a larger number of chlorine atoms. PCB congeners can be divided into dioxin-like and non–dioxin-like groups based on their structure and toxicological properties. Twelve congeners have a dioxin-like planar structure and toxicological properties similar to dioxins. Table 10.1.1 lists the PCB congeners — including both dioxin-like and non–dioxin-like PCBs — measured in pooled serum in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). Commercial mixtures of PCBs are also known under a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor, Chloretol, Dyknol, Inerteem, Kanechlor, Noflamol, Phenoclor and Pyranol (ATSDR, 2000).

Return to Table footnote a referrer PCBs were produced synthetically as mixtures for various industrial applications up until the late 1970s, mainly in the United States, but also in countries such as Germany, Italy, France and Japan (ATSDR, 2000). Products containing PCBs include electrical capacitors and transformers, heat transfer and hydraulic fluids, flame retardants, inks, adhesives, lubricants, surface coatings, anti-fouling agents and plasticizers (ATSDR, 2000). PCBs have never been manufactured in Canada, but were imported and widely used (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). Production ceased in most countries by the late 1970s or early 1980s. However, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continued to manufacture PCBs until at least 2006 (Environment Canada, 2006; IARC, 2016). In Canada, PCBs and products containing them have primarily been used in electricity generation, transmission and distribution (Environment Canada, 2013). The use of PCBs has been restricted in Canada since 1977. It is currently limited to products in use prior to 1977 (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). PCBs do not occur naturally in the environment. Entry may occur through use or improper disposal practices. PCBs have been detected in a wide array of environmental media, including air, water, soil and dust (ATSDR, 2000). Once in the environment, PCBs are persistent and bioaccumulative. The more chlorinated congeners adsorb strongly to sediment and soil, with half-lives of months to years (ATSDR, 2000). PCBs also have the ability to undergo long-range transport. They have been detected in air, sediments, water and biota in remote places far from areas of use (Carlsson et al., 2018; NCP, 2013). Monitoring of ambient air and biota from Canada’s Arctic indicates that levels of PCBs declined from the 1980s to the 2010s, along with the levels of many other legacy persistent organic pollutants (Braune et al., 2019; Houde et al., 2019; NCP, 2013). In the general population, the primary route of exposure to PCBs is expected to be the ingestion of food, including breast milk (IARC, 2016). Exposure to PCBs usually involves mixtures of individual congeners. The specific PCB congeners found in food and environmental media vary, but six congeners (PCBs 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180) are generally found at higher concentrations relative to others (IARC, 2016). Dietary studies have demonstrated that fish generally contain the highest levels of PCBs, followed by meat and dairy products (ATSDR, 2000). Inhalation and dermal contact are additional sources of exposure (ATSDR, 2000). Once absorbed following inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact, PCBs accumulate in lipid-rich tissues — particularly the liver, adipose tissue and skin — and in breast milk. PCBs are metabolized by various cytochrome P-450 enzymes to polar metabolites that can undergo conjugation with glutathione and glucuronic acid. The rate and extent of metabolism depend on the chlorine number and position in the congener; the less chlorinated congeners are metabolized more rapidly. Elimination of PCBs from the body occurs through feces, urine and breast milk (ATSDR, 2000). Congeners with higher numbers of chlorine atoms tend to have longer half-lives (ATSDR, 2000; Grimm et al., 2015). Half-life estimates from occupational exposures range from 4.6 years for PCB 28 to 41 years for PCB 156 (Seegal et al., 2011). PCBs can be measured in human serum, blood plasma and milk. PCB congener profiles in human serum immediately following exposure reflect the profiles present in the source; however, selective metabolism, excretion and deposition begin to alter the congener profile within 4–24 hours. Thus, in most cases, the PCB congener profile in tissues represents a steady-state body burden that does not match the profile of environmental mixtures of commercial PCB formulations (ATSDR, 2000). The predominant congeners identified in human tissues are PCBs 138, 153 and 180 (ATSDR, 2000). Levels of PCBs in blood indicate body burden (ATSDR, 2000). Animal studies have shown that exposures to high levels of PCBs can have detrimental effects on the liver, endocrine system, skin, immune system, nervous system and reproductive system, and on fetal and infant development (ATSDR, 2000; Environment Canada, 2001; WHO, 2000). Human studies of PCB toxicity have generally been limited by the inability to distinguish its effects from those of other contaminants present during PCB exposure. Several birth cohort studies have shown that developmental neurotoxicity (through thyroid and neurotransmitter disruption) may be associated with prenatal, perinatal and/or postnatal exposure to PCBs even at background environmental levels, although the results are inconsistent (Berghuis and Roze, 2019; Boucher et al., 2016; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2005; Koopman-Esseboom et al., 1994; Verner et al., 2015; Walkowiak et al., 2001; Wilhelm et al., 2008). The toxicity of dioxin-like PCBs is mediated through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, resulting in the same or similar health effects as dioxins, including hepatotoxicity. More detailed information about the toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals can be found in section 7.1 (Dioxins and Furans). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (2016) has classified both dioxin-like and non–dioxin-like PCBs as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1). The toxicity of combined dioxin-like chemicals can be expressed in terms of a total toxic equivalent (TEQ) to facilitate evaluations of the human health risks posed by these complex mixtures (Consonni et al., 2012; WHO, 2010). An overview of the TEQ approach is provided in Appendix B. PCBs with more than two chlorine atoms are listed on Schedule 1, List of Toxic Substances, under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 (CEPA 1999) and classified as persistent organic pollutants by the Stockholm Convention (Canada, 1999; Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017; UNEP, 2008). The Government of Canada considers them to be persistent, bioaccumulative, toxic and primarily the result of human activity. As such, PCBs are targeted for virtual elimination from the environment (Track 1 substance) (Canada, 1998). Risk management actions under CEPA 1999 have been developed to prevent the release of PCBs to the environment and accelerate their phase-out (Canada, 2008). PCBs have been analyzed as part of Health Canada's Total Diet Study surveys (Health Canada, 2016). Internationally, Canada is also working with the United Nations to eliminate the production and use of PCBs and reduce their unintentional release through the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2017). PCBs have been measured in pooled blood samples from pregnant women during regional biomonitoring studies conducted in Alberta, northern Saskatchewan and Nunavik. In 2005, the Alberta Biomonitoring Program conducted a biomonitoring study among pregnant women living in Alberta (Alberta Health and Wellness, 2008). Serum samples from 28,484 individuals were combined into 158 pools. PCBs 180, 183 and 187 were most commonly detected, with mean ranges of 1.3–13 ng/g lipid, 5.6–8.8 ng/g lipid and 1.0–22 ng/g lipid, respectively. The Northern Saskatchewan Biomonitoring Study was carried out from 2011–2013 in pregnant women living in northern Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, 2019). Serum samples from 841 individuals were combined into six pools. PCBs 18, 28 and 52 were most commonly detected, with means of 61 ng/g lipid, 23 ng/g lipid and 16 ng/g lipid, respectively. In 2013, a study of emerging Arctic contaminants was conducted in Nunavik under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme MercuNorth Project (Caron et al., 2019). Five pools of plasma samples from 78 pregnant women were analyzed for PCBs. PCBs 138, 153 and 180 were most commonly detected, with geometric means of 24.30 ng/g lipid, 57.54 ng/g lipid and 24.92 ng/g lipid, respectively. PCBs have also been measured in individual plasma samples as part of the CHMS and other Canadian biomonitoring studies. In cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the CHMS, 24 PCBs were measured in individual blood plasma samples from the Canadian population aged 20–79 (Health Canada, 2010). PCBs 138, 153 and 180 were the most commonly detected, with geometric means of 10.13 ng/g lipid, 18.31 ng/g lipid and 15.21 ng/g lipid, respectively. Factors associated with total PCB plasma concentrations in the CHMS were age, region of birth, frequency of fish consumption, and liver consumption (Singh et al., 2019). The population coverage of the CHMS excludes persons living on reserves and in other Indigenous settlements in Canadian provinces. However, this subpopulation was surveyed in 2011 as part of the First Nations Biomonitoring Initiative (FNBI), a nationally representative biomonitoring study of adult First Nations peoples living on reserves south of the 60th parallel (AFN, 2013). The study comprised 13 randomly selected First Nations communities in Canada with 471 First Nations participants aged 20 and older. As with the CHMS, PCBs 138, 153 and 180 were most commonly detected, with geometric means of 6.42 ng/g lipid, 12.67 ng/g lipid and 10.45 ng/g lipid, respectively. The Maternal–Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study is a national-level prospective cohort study that recruited 2,001 pregnant women aged 18 years and older from 10 cities across Canada from 2008–2011 (Arbuckle et al., 2013). In the MIREC study, which involved 1,928 participants in their first trimester of pregnancy, PCBs 118, 138, 153 and 180 were the most highly detected, with geometric means of 2.36 ng/g lipid, 4.21 ng/g lipid, 7.30 ng/g lipid and 4.88 ng/g lipid, respectively (Fisher et al., 2016). In northern Canada, the contaminant component of the Inuit Health Survey (2007–2008) and the Nunavik Inuit Health Survey (2004) measured the body burden of PCBs in 3,083 Inuit participants from communities in Nunavut, Nunavik, Nunatsiavut and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (NCP, 2018). The geometric means for PCBs 99, 118, 138, 153 and 180 in plasma for Inuit men and women (18 years and older) ranged from 6.5–200 ng/g lipid, with the highest concentration measured for PCB 153. Continuous monitoring among communities in Nunavik indicates that the geometric means of PCBs have declined since 1992 (NCP, 2018). Thirty-six PCB congeners (Table 10.1.1) were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1.Twenty-one PCB congeners were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), cycle 4 (2014–2015) and cycle 5 (2016–2017). Data from these cycles for PCBs 77, 81, 126 and 169 are presented as pg/g lipid and pg/g serum; for the remaining PCB congeners, they are presented as ng/g lipid and ng/g serum. Finding a measurable amount of PCB congeners in serum is an indicator of exposure to PCBs. It does not necessarily mean that an adverse health effect will occur. Rawn et al. (2012) published PCB data from pooled serum samples collected in cycle 1 of the CHMS. These previously published results were generated using a different statistical approach. As a result, they are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report.

Appendix A: Limits of detection For cycle 1 (2007–2009) of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), laboratory analyses of environmental chemicals were performed by the Food Research Division of Health Canada’s Health Products and Food Branch (Ontario, Canada). Mean limits of detection (LODs) were established using a 3:1 signal to baseline noise ratio (Rawn et al., 2012; Rawn et al., 2014). Mean LODs for cycle 1 are presented as weight of chemical per gram of lipid in Table A-1. For cycles 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017) of the CHMS, laboratory analyses of environmental chemicals were performed at the Food Laboratory Toronto, part of Health Canada’s Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch. The LODs are defined as the lowest concentration of the analyte whose analytical response is measured to be greater than the noise level with 99% confidence. For hexabromocyclododecane, tetrabromobisphenol A and the organochlorine pesticides, the LODs were determined for the analysis methods and are constant for each pool analyzed (Table A-2). Conversely, an individual LOD was generated for each pool in the analyses for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (furans), polybrominated diphenyl ethers and polychlorinated biphenyls. For these analytes, the mean and range (minimum to maximum) of LOD values are given in Table A-3. The minimum LOD was the lowest and the maximum LOD was the highest among all pooled samples analyzed. LODs for cycles 3, 4 and 5 are presented as weight of chemical per gram of lipid. The mean LODs can be converted to units of whole weight using the mean lipid content for pools (cycle 1: 0.61%, cycle 3: 0.49%, cycle 4: 0.48%, cycle 5: 0.46%) and the formula: Mean whole weight (ng/g serum) = mean lipid weight (ng/g lipid) x mean lipid content / 100.

Appendix B: Toxic equivalence values for dioxins and dioxin-like compounds Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (dioxins) and other related compounds, including polychlorinated dibenzofurans (furans) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are a group of structurally related chlorinated organic chemicals. Humans can be exposed to these persistent organic pollutants through the environment and food (ATSDR, 1994; ATSDR, 1998; ATSDR, 2000). Exposures usually involve mixtures of individual dioxin, furan and dioxin-like PCB congeners. The toxic and biological effects of these compounds are mediated through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Van den Berg et al., 2006). More information is available in sections 7.1 (dioxins and furans) and 10.1 (PCBs), including details on sources, health effects and regulations. Due to the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like compounds in complex mixtures and their similar mechanism of toxicity, it is valuable to be able to determine the cumulative toxicity of exposure to multiple congeners. The toxic equivalency concept was developed in the 1980s to address this (Van den Berg et al., 2006). This approach assigns a toxic equivalency factor (TEF) from 0–1 to each of the congeners of toxicological concern. Based on chemical structure and information from toxicology studies, the TEF value scales the toxicity of each dioxin or dioxin-like compound relative to the toxicity of the reference compound, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) (EPA, 2010; Van den Berg et al., 2006). The reference compound has been well studied toxicologically, is the most toxic form of dioxin and has a TEF value of 1. A TEF can be assigned to a dioxin-like chemical that has a similar structure to dioxins and furans, is known to be persistent and accumulate in the food chain and has the capacity to elicit a biological and toxicological response via binding to the AhR (Van den Berg et al., 2006). The application of TEFs is based on the concept of dose addition, which assumes that these chemicals will have similar toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic behaviours, including a similar shape of the dose–response curve. Multiplying the measured concentration of an individual congener by its specific TEF allows the expression of each chemical dose in terms of its toxicity equivalence to 2,3,7,8-TCDD (EPA, 2010). These products can then be summed to give a unique value called the total toxic equivalent (TEQ), which is an estimate of the total 2,3,7,8-TCDD-like activity of a mixture of dioxin-like compounds (ATSDR, 1998; EPA, 2010; Van den Berg et al., 2006). The first set of TEF values was developed in 1994. These were subsequently re-evaluated, and an updated set of TEF values was published in 1998 (EPA, 2010; Van den Berg, 1998). In 2005, a World Health Organization expert panel updated the values again, leading to the most recent set of TEF values listed in Table B-1 (Van den Berg et al., 2006).

For most of these studies, TEQs have not been produced. However, Rawn et al. (2012) published TEQs based upon pooled serum data from Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) cycle 1 (2007–2009). These previously published results were generated using a different statistical approach. As a result, they are not directly comparable with the data presented in this report. The dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs listed in Table B-1 were analyzed in pooled serum samples of CHMS participants aged 6–79 in cycle 1 and aged 3–79 in cycle 3 (2012–2013), 4 (2014–2015) and 5 (2016–2017). WHO 2005 TEF values were applied to these data to derive the TEQ values presented as pg TEQ/g lipid in Tables B-2 to B-8. These tables present TEQ values derived for the sum of dioxins; the sum of furans; the sum of dioxins and furans; the sum of mono-ortho PCBs; the sum of non-ortho PCBs; the sum of dioxin-like PCBs; and the sum of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs. The data tables include the number of pools, minimum and maximum concentrations, the weighted arithmetic mean concentrations, and the coefficients of variation associated with the arithmetic means. TEQs are calculated for each pool, and the results are presented for the total population as well as by sex and age group. Measurements for individual compounds that fell below the LOD for the laboratory analytical method were assigned a value equal to half the LOD. In addition, pools with missing data due to sample loss were assigned a value equal to the weighted mean of available results for the age/sex group that the missing pool represented. These imputed values were used to calculate the TEQs. As imputation impacts variance estimation, additional caution should be exercised when interpreting the CV for TEQs derived based upon imputed data.
