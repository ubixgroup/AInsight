Factors that contribute to poor IAQ may be related to inadequate ventilation system design, or maintenance and operation, which are generally under the control of the building owner or the employer. Building stewardship activities such as housekeeping and cleaning by maintenance and janitorial staff can impact IAQ, while office occupants can also impact IAQ through activities such as wearing fragrances, blocking air return vents or opening/closing doors. Building operators The building operator includes the building owner and property managers. There may be instances where the building operator is also the employer. Building operators maintain IAQ through preventive maintenance and investigation into issues or reported complaints of poor air quality. Building operators and employers should work collaboratively to prevent, reduce, and eliminate sources of indoor air contaminants through good building stewardship practices and appropriately maintain the ventilation system. As a best practice, it is recommended that building operators: ensure that the HVAC system is configured correctly. This responsibility may include consulting with a qualified professional have adequate knowledge of the ventilation system's operation (e.g., knowing intake and exhaust locations, timing of air exchanges if on a schedule) use appropriate air filters and replacing them when required; have scheduled preventive maintenance activities conducted on the ventilation system by a qualified professional, as required by the manufacturer maintain the building to prevent/repair damage, cracks, water leaks, air infiltration maintain building floor plans and updating the plans as required; and conduct a risk assessment before changing office layouts, floor plans, or parking areas as it relates to the ventilation system Employers Employers have an overall responsibility to maintain a healthy and safe workplace, taking every reasonable precaution to prevent injuries, incidents or illness in the workplace. To help ensure IAQ in the workplace is maintained adequately, it is recommended that employers: ensure the development and implementation of a formal reporting process to ensure that communication regarding building issues is handled consistently over time make sure that building systems and controls are in place, functioning and maintained appropriately have procedures in place to follow when investigating issues or concerns regarding IAQ implement any controls that may be necessary to maintain or improve IAQ provide the necessary resources to maintain or improve IAQ provide communication to workers relating to IAQ or investigations Employers will benefit by implementing an IAQ management program that outlines: the roles and responsibilities of all parties contact information for reporting IAQ concerns and issues how to record and address IAQ concerns and issues education and training how to investigate and resolve IAQ issues operation and maintenance of the building and ventilation system managing air contaminants and sources a review of the IAQ management program Health and safety committee or representative The health and safety committee or representative is fundamental to supporting the health and safety activities at a workplace in Canada. The Canada Labour Code outlines the responsibilities of the health and safety committee as follows: "A work place committee, in respect of the work place for which it is established, shall consider and expeditiously dispose of complaints relating to the health and safety of employees". As it relates to IAQ, the health and safety committee or representative has the right and responsibility to: participate in workplace investigations and inspections inquire into and monitor the status of ongoing investigations receive reports related to health and safety activities monitor the effectiveness of the health and safety program provide recommendations to the employer Workers Under occupational health and safety legislation, workers have the duty to report any workplace hazard that causes, or may cause, an injury or illness. Concerns or potential issues can be discussed with a supervisor, the health and safety committee or representative (if present), the union (if present) or the employer. Workers should also follow the workplace's policies regarding the use of products (such as cleaning products, scented products) and safe work procedures (such as housekeeping, handling or storing chemicals) to help maintain good IAQ.
