ISSUE SHEET – HEALTH WORKER CRISIS
HEALTH WORKER VACANCIES
Based on vacancy data from Statistics Canada, shortages have increased over the last few years across
most health occupations. In fact, health occupations are the only ones to report a year-over year rise in
job vacancies in the second quarter of 2023.
Nursing occupations in particular saw vacancy rates increase steadily through the years leading up to and
throughout the pandemic.
Health occupations with the most job vacancies were, in order: nursing occupations, PSWs, dental
hygienists/ therapists/ assistants, other medical technologists and technicians, physiotherapists, other
assisting occupations in support of health services, and occupational therapists. Combined, these
occupations represent 90% of all health sector vacancies.
Vacancy rates in the second quarter of 2023:
Registered Nurses and Registered Psychiatric Nurses: 29,655
Licensed Practical Nurses: 13,560
Job vacancies in the Health sector:
First quarter of 2020 – 43,390
Second quarter of 2023 – 89,995
While the supply of nurses is continuously increasing, the growth is not enough to meet the demand. In
2022, the total nursing supply in Canada was 466,014. From 2017 to 2022, the nursing supply increased
by 9%.
The number of Registered Nurses graduating increased by 6.1% in 2022 over 2021.
The supply of LPNs grew by 2.5% from 2021 to 2022.
Nursing in particular struggles with long-term vacancies (vacancies that last 90 days or more). Long-term
job vacancies increased for registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses from 55.6% in the second
quarter of 2022 to 63.3% in the second quarter of 2023 and licensed practical nurses from 56.5% to
62.8%.
The fastest-growing groups of health care professionals in 2021 were physician assistants (17.9%), nurse
practitioners (10.7%) and social workers (7.5%) suggesting that better integration of these professionals
into the Canadian healthcare system could help address the crisis.
To ensure Canada has a sustainable, efficient and resilient health workforce that provides Canadians with
timely access to high-quality, effective and safe health services, Provinces and Territories will increase
the number of net new family physicians, nurses, and nurse practitioners over the next five years.
Between 2021 and 2022, Canada gained:
1,794 net new LPNs (annual growth rate of 2%; 2,274 net new RNs (annual growth rate of 1%); 618 net
new NPs (annual growth rate of 10%); 112 net new registered psychiatric nurses (annual growth rate of
2%).
Canada gained 333 net new family medicine physicians, 7,524 net new registered nurses, and 640 net
new nurse practitioners (CIHI analysis for Health Canada, 2023)
In 2021, the supply of physicians grew at 2.0% compared with 2020, the increase was just 1.2% for family
medicine physicians versus 2.8% for specialists in 2021.
FORECAST OF FUTURE SHORTAGES
Survey of Ontario Nurses: 2022-2023 – estimated 15.6% loss in the nursing profession due to planned
retirements and anticipated post-pandemic departures
Report from Mental Health Commission of Canada (September 2022):
40% of health care workers are burned out
50% of health care workers intend to leave the profession
60% of health care workers are satisfied with the quality of care they provide
Physician shortages are dominated by those in family medicine – a field facing diminishing popularity for
trainees. Family doctors account for 51% of the workforce and only 40% of those graduating and is the
specialty choice of only 31% of incoming medical students.
IMPACT OF HEALTHCARE SHORTAGES
14.5% of Canadians do not have a primary health care provider.
2020 – 38% of Canadians reported their last emergency department visit was for a family health care
treatable condition.
Nearly 90% of Canadians indicated that addressing shortages of doctors and nurses should be a top or
high priority in a survey conducted by the Privy Council Office in February 2022.
SURGICAL BACKLOGS
According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), from March 2020 to June 2021, almost
560,000 fewer surgeries were performed due to cancellations and delays, compared with the pre-
pandemic period (excluding Quebec).
The largest drop occurred in Wave 1, with approximately 370,000 fewer surgeries. By the summer of
2020, most jurisdictions had resumed the delayed surgeries, with some even exceeding pre-pandemic
surgical volumes in an effort to clear backlogs.
Overall, in Wave 2 the number of surgeries was within 4% of pre-pandemic levels.
During Wave 3, with rising numbers of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, some regions (Ontario,
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and British Columbia) delayed surgeries again.
In March 2022, Health Canada previously estimated a cost of approximately $2B to clear the surgical
backlog within 2 years, assuming a stable backlog by the end of the month (approximately 700,000
procedures). Due to ongoing healthcare system capacity challenges associated with COVID-19 variants,
the backlog did not stabilize at that time.
Based on more recent internal analysis by Health Canada, the estimated number of surgical cancellations
during the COVID-19 pandemic may be closer to 940,000 procedures as of September 2022.
INTERNATIONAL EDUCATED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (IEHPs)
In 2021, approximately one-quarter of the physician workforce (26.2%) was internationally educated.
Physiotherapists and pharmacists also had large proportions of internationally educated professionals
(22% and 34%, respectively). In comparison, smaller proportions of occupational therapist and regulated
nurse workforces were internationally educated (6% and 9%, respectively) .
However, according to Census 2021 data , too many IEHPs in Canada are not working in the health-
related field:
Over 33% of all IMGs in Canada are working in non-health occupations.
Over 31% of all IENs in Canada are also working in non-health related field.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
Canada Health Transfer: Budget 2023 confirmed the federal government’s plan to provide $198.6 billion
over 10 years, for provinces and territories to improve health care services for Canadians. One of the
priority areas of this funding is to further support the health workforce and reduce backlogs caused by
COVID-19. This includes:
An immediate and unconditional $2 billion CHT top-up to address immediate pressures on the health
care system, especially in pediatric hospitals and emergency rooms, and long wait times for surgeries.
In addition to $6B provided in previous two years to help address immediate health system pressures,
including reducing medical backlogs caused by COVID-19.
$25 billion over 10 years to advance shared health priorities through tailored bilateral agreements that
will support the needs of people in each province and territory in four areas of shared priority: family
health services; health workers and backlogs; mental health and substance use; and a modernized health
system. These additional federal investments will be contingent on continued health care investments by
provinces and territories.
This funding builds on the $7.8 billion over five years that has yet to flow to provinces and territories for
mental health and substance use, home and community care, and long-term care.
$1.7 billion over five years to support personal support workers and related professions, as federal,
provincial, and territorial governments work together on how best to support recruitment and retention.
$2 billion over 10 years to address the unique challenges Indigenous Peoples face when it comes to fair
and equitable access to quality and culturally safe health care services.
$505 million over 5 years to CIHI, Canada Health Infoway and federal data partners to work with
provinces and territories on developing new health data indicators, to support the creation of a Centre
of Excellence on health worker data, to advance digital health tools and an interoperability roadmap, and
to underpin efforts to use data to improve safety and quality of care.
On October 12, 2023 FPT Ministers of Health issued a public statement reaffirming their commitment to
supporting Canada’s health workforce so our health workers are able to provide high-quality, accessible,
and effective health services for people living in Canada. In particular, FPT governments committed to
concrete actions focusing on retention, domestic education supply and demand, foreign credential
recognition and ethical recruitment, labour mobility, and health workforce data and planning. In order to
advance these priorities, the Government of Canada is taking action, including:
Focusing efforts on retaining our health workforce through the Nursing Retention Forum and the
creation of the “Nursing Retention Toolkit: Improving the Working Lives of Nurses in Canada” which is set
for release in the coming months.
Funding the creation of the Centre of Excellence for the Future of the Health Workforce, a partnership
with the Canadian Institute for Health Information that will lead a collaborative pan-Canadian approach
to improve data collection, analysis, knowledge mobilization, and policy advice.
Funding a study of the education and training supply and demand for key healthcare professions to
identify the best pan-Canadian approaches to meet future healthcare demands for Canadians over the
next decade, including misalignment across regions and settings.
In August 2023, Health Canada appointed Dr. Genevieve Moineau as Chief Medical Workforce Advisor
(CMWA) to help support the federal response to current health workforce challenges.
In June 2023, as part of the first-ever launch of category based selection for Canada's flagship economic
immigration management system, Express Entry, Health Canada worked with Immigration, Refugees, and
Citizenship Canada (IRCC) on category-based selection to allow Canada to issue invitations to apply to
prospective permanent residents with specific work experience in health care.
In November 2022, the Government of Canada established a Coalition for Action for Health Workers. The
Coalition’s advice is informing immediate and longer-term solutions to address significant health
workforce challenges, so that all Canadians can access the quality care they need and deserve.
On August 23, 2022, Health Canada announced that it had appointed Dr. Leigh Chapman as the federal
Chief Nursing Officer (CNO). Dr. Chapman has brought nursing issues into focus federally, while working
closely with provinces and territories, and key nursing stakeholders.
On October 4, 2022, the Government of Canada announced $1.2 million in funding to the Canadian
Association for Long Term Care (LTC) to adapt and deliver The Working Mind program for frontline
employees, managers and supervisors in LTC homes across Canada. This is part of the $50 million
committed through Budget 2021 to address PTSD frontline and essential workers.
On September 23 2022, the Government of Canada announced that Immigration, Refugees, and
Citizenship Canada is exempting physicians, who work in a fee-for-service model with public health
authorities, from current requirements. This change recognizes the unique employment model used in
Canada’s health care system, and will provide physicians with access to Canada’s economic permanent
residence programs. This change came into effect in April 2023 and will mean that a greater number of
physicians already here and filling crucial vacancies in our health care sector can remain here
permanently.
Budget 2022
$115M over 5 years to expand the Foreign Credential Recognition Program and help up to 11,000
internationally trained health care professionals per year get their credentials recognized and find work
in their field
$26.2 million over four years, starting in 2023-24, and $7 million ongoing, to increase the maximum
amount of forgivable Canada Student Loans by 50 per cent. This will mean up to $30,000 in loan
forgiveness for nurses and up to $60,000 in loan forgiveness for doctors working in underserved rural or
remote communities.
On March 25, 2022, the Government introduced Bill C-17 in the House of Commons, which would
provide an additional $2 billion one-time top-up to the Canada Health Transfer to address backlogs,
distributed equally per capita to provinces and territories.
Budget 2021
$45M over two years to develop national standards for mental health and substance use services,
including tools to support mental health providers.
$960 million over three years to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) for a new Sectoral
Workforce Solutions Program to help connect Canadians with the training they need to access jobs in
high-demand sectors, such as healthcare.
ISSUE SHEET – DENTAL
UNMET DENTAL CARE NEEDS
Access to quality oral health care is an integral part of overall health yet many Canadians face barriers.
2.26 million school days are missed each year due to dental-related illness.
Tooth decay accounts for one-third of all day surgeries performed on children between the ages of one
and five in Canada1.
Much of the burden of dental disease is concentrated in disadvantaged children: those from low-income
families; Indigenous children; new immigrants; and children with special health care needs.
1 in 5 people (6 million Canadians) are not receiving needed dental care due to cost.
Canadians with financial resources or insurance are more likely to experience good oral health.
One-third of the population cannot afford to pay for dental care, which is why our government is taking
steps toward a Canada-wide dental care program for those who need it most.
CURRENT DENTAL PROGRAMS IN CANADA
$14.7 billion was spent on dental services in 2020 :
54% was covered through private insurance
40% was paid out-of-pocket
6% was publicly funded
In 2018, 64.6% of Canadians reported they had dental insurance that covered all or part of their
expenses. PTs provide coverage for medically-necessary oral health services that take place in hospital
and offer some form of public dental coverage.The Government of Canada also currently provides dental
coverage for public servants, members of the Armed Forces and veterans, people incarcerated in federal
correctional facilities, some newcomers, registered First Nations people and recognized Inuit.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
The interim Canada Dental Benefit provides direct payments to eligible applicants of up to $650 per child
under 12 years old, per year and up to $1,300 over two years.
Budget 2023 proposed funding of $13 billion over five years starting in 2023-24, and $4.4 billion ongoing,
to implement the Canadian Dental Care Plan. It also proposed $250 million over three years, starting in
2025-26, and $75 million ongoing to Health Canada to establish an Oral Health Access Fund, which will
address oral health gaps for vulnerable populations and reduce barriers to accessing care, and $23.1
million over two years, starting in 2023-24 to support Dental Care Data.
CANADA DENTAL BENEFIT (CDB) – interim measure
CDB launched on December 1, 2022 and is delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
It is a first step towards fulfilling the Government of Canada’s commitment to the development of a long-
term Canada-wide dental care plan for low and middle income families.
It provides direct payments, over two potential benefit periods, to eligible applicants. For example:
up to $650 per year per child for those with an adjusted family net income under $70,000
up to $390 per year per child for those with an adjusted family net income of $70,000 to $79,999
up to $260 per year per child for those with an adjusted family net income of $80,000 to $89,999
The first interim benefit period (December 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023) helped approximately
323,000 children. Applications are currently being received for the second interim benefit period (July 1,
2023 to June 30, 2024). On July 21, 2023, the Government publicly announced that over 100,000
children had already been helped during the second interim benefit period.
Statistics from the CRA website show that as of September 20, 2023, approximately:370,000 children
have been helped by the interim Canada Dental Benefit since it was launched in December 2022. (Note:
Children who benefitted in both periods are counted once in this total.)
$315,207,000 is the total value of benefit payments
CANADIAN DENTAL CARE PLAN (CDCP) – long-term measure
The CDCP is still under development and details have not been announced. The plan is expected to begin
by the end of 2023 and information will be communicated in the coming weeks.
Up to 9 million uninsured Canadian residents with an adjusted family net income under $90,000 could
benefit from the CDCP.
In September 2023, it was announced that an Early Work Agreement was awarded to Sun Life Assurance
Company of Canada (Sun Life) to do pre-contractual work to ensure the timely launch and successful
operation of the CDCP.
An Oral Health Access Fund, led by Health Canada, will begin to provide grants and contributions funding
in 2025-26. It will complement the CDCP by supporting projects that further reduce access barriers for
Canada’s vulnerable populations (e.g. those living in rural and remote communities and equity seeking
groups, such as persons with disabilities).
ISSUE SHEET- PHARMACARE INITIATIVES
CANADA PHARMACARE ACT
The mandate letter from the Prime Minister reiterated the Government of Canada’s commitment to
continue engaging with willing provinces and territories towards national universal pharmacare, while
proceeding with a national strategy for drugs for rare diseases and advancing the establishment of the
Canadian Drug Agency.
Budget 2022 announced that the federal government’s ongoing work towards national pharmacare will
include:
tabling a Canada Pharmacare bill, and
then tasking the Canadian Drug Agency to develop a national formulary of essential medicines and bulk
purchasing plan by the end of the agreement (June 2025).
We look forward to working with all Parliamentarians to ensure that Canadians have better access to the
drugs they need.
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND (PEI) INITIATIVE
On August 11, 2021, the Government of Canada announced the signing of the first agreement with the
Government of Prince Edward Island (PEI) to inform the advancement of national pharmacare.
Through this agreement, PEI will receive $35 million in federal funding, to:
add new drugs to its list of covered drugs, and
lower out of pocket costs for drugs covered under existing public plans for Island residents.
The Government of Canada will use early lessons from PEI’s efforts to inform its ongoing work to
advance national universal pharmacare.
Since January 23, 2023, PEI expanded access to a total of 85 new medications to treat a variety of
conditions including cancer, heart disease, migraine, and multiple sclerosis.
Effective June 1, 2023, PEI expanded its provincial drug coverage to reduce co-pays to $5 for almost 60%
of medications regularly used by Islanders and removed barriers to the High-Cost Drug Program making
it available to all income levels. As of August 16, 2023, Islanders have saved over $675,000 in out-of-
pocket costs on more than 77,000 prescriptions under the $5 co-pay program.
PEI also lowered the cap on the amount of money a household spends on eligible medications under the
Catastrophic Drug Program as of July 1, 2023.
DRUGS FOR RARE DISEASES
On March 22, 2023, the Government of Canada announced the launch of the first-ever National Strategy
for Drugs for Rare Diseases, supported by investments of up to $1.5 billion over three years. This first
phase aims to increase access to and affordability of effective drugs for rare diseases, which will
contribute to improving the health of patients across Canada.
As part of the overall investment, the federal government will make available up to $1.4 billion over
three years to provinces and territories to improve access to new and emerging drugs, as well as to
support enhanced access to existing drugs, early diagnosis, and screening for rare diseases.
Similarly, to ensure that eligible First Nations and Inuit clients with rare diseases will also benefit, the
Government is providing up to $33 million over the first three years to Indigenous Services Canada’s
Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.
The Federal Government is also making key investments of a total of up to $68 million for various
initiatives to be led by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), the Canadian
Institute for Health Information (CIHI), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to advance
the collection and use of evidence to support decision making and critical rare disease research.
Health Canada is now working with provinces and territories on bilateral agreements, starting with
jointly determining a small set of new and emerging drugs that would be cost-shared and covered in a
consistent way across the country.
CADTH/CIHI are making progress on six key activities to support decision-making across the
pharmaceutical lifecycle, including hiring resources, engaging provinces and territories, drafting of
criteria to guide analysis of disease registries, and identifying key experts to support their work.
CIHR launched four funding opportunities between June and August 2023, and funding is expected to
start flowing for the largest project in January 2024, with remaining three projects beginning funding in
April 2024.
Health Canada is working to establish national governance structures, including a patient and
stakeholder Implementation Advisory Group (IAG) comprised of individuals drawn from a range of
perspectives and roles, including patients, caregivers, clinicians, and industry. This mechanism will be
central to keeping patients at the centre of the Strategy.
CANADIAN DRUG AGENCY (CDA)
Supported by a $35M investment in Budget 2019, the Canadian Drug Agency Transition Office (CDATO)
was established in 2021 to develop options for a vision, mandate and plan to create a Canadian Drug
Agency (CDA).
Informed by significant engagement – over 400 meetings and roundtables – with patients, insurers,
pharmaceutical companies, prescribers and academics, the CDATO is advancing work on core functions
which are supported by high consensus and will pave the way for greater collaboration as the CDA is
built:
Appropriate prescribing and use – collaborating with leaders in the appropriate use field to improve
health outcomes and ensure patients are prescribed the safest and most effective treatments for their
conditions.
Data and analytics – working with partners to determine how the CDA can support drug plans, provide
information to decision-makers, and help to standardize and improve access to drug and treatment data
and analytics to improve patient outcomes.
System Coordination – partnering to build a CDA that improves system efficiency, reduces duplication
and streamlines processes, ensuring that the Agency is well-positioned to adapt and evolve to address
the ever-changing pharmaceuticals landscape.
NATIONAL FORMULARY
Following broad consultations, a multidisciplinary national panel established to develop a draft formulary
framework released its final report in June 2022.
The panel recommended:
guiding principles;
a staged approach, including a proposed sample list of commonly prescribed drugs and related products
for three common conditions (heart disease, diabetes, mental health)
other key elements such as a deliberative process to select and evaluate products and an appeal process
The panel’s work was overseen by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), at
the request of Health Canada.
The panel was composed of 2 co-chairs and 12 members. Its members were recruited from across
Canada and represented diversity across gender, culture, and race. The panel brought together a range
of expertise and experience, including health care providers (nursing, pharmacy, and medicine), persons
with lived and living experience, and individuals with backgrounds in ethics and health policy.
ISSUE SHEET – PATENTED MEDICINE PRICES REVIEW BOARD (PMPRB)
PMPRB BACKGROUND
The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) is an independent quasi-judicial body that protects
the interests of Canadian consumers by ensuring that the prices of patented medicines sold in Canada
are not excessive.
Created in 1987, through the Patent Act, the PMPRB is part of the Health Portfolio, but carries out its
regulatory mandate at arm’s length (i.e. independently) from the Minister of Health.
PMPRB has a dual mandate:
In its regulatory role, it protects consumers by ensuring that the prices of patented medicines are not
excessive.
In its reporting role, it provides information on pricing trends in the pharmaceutical industry via its
Annual Reports.
MEMBERS OF THE BOARD
A Board of five members oversees PMPRB. Members serve on a part time basis and are appointed by the
Governor-in-Council. Member terms are for a period of five years.
The current Board members are:
Chairperson, Thomas Digby, appointed 2023-01-27
Vice-Chairperson, Anie Perrault, appointed 2023-08-10
Member, Carolyn Kobernick, appointed 2014-06-13 and renewed 2019-06-13

REGULATORY AMENDMENTS TO THE PATENTED MEDICINES REGULATIONS
On July 1st, 2022, amendments to the Patented Medicines Regulations (PMR) came into force. The
amendments include:
A new 11-country basket of comparator countries; and
decreased reporting requirements for medicines at low risk of excessive prices (e.g. generic drugs, over-
the-counter drugs and veterinary drugs)/
The new basket of comparator countries removes the United States and Switzerland and includes
countries with similar consumer protection priorities, economic wealth and marketed medicines as
Canada. The basket now comprises of Australia, Belgium, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and Spain, along
with France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and United Kingdom, which have always been included.
The total quantified benefit of the revised basket, calculated through a cost-benefit analysis conducted in
2017, estimated the impact of the regulatory amendment on patented medicine prices to be $2.9 billion
over 10 years (according to the June 2022 Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement).
PMPRB GUIDELINES
The Board of the PMPRB may issue non-binding Guidelines to operationalize the Regulations. Since the
coming into force of the regulatory amendments in July 2022, there are no Guidelines are in place.
In October 2022, PMPRB proposed draft Guidelines for a 60-day Notice and Comment Period. In
December 2022, PMPRB announced that it would not implement the proposed Guidelines, and the
Interim Guidance would remain in place until further notice
The Interim Guidance, adopted in July 2022 and updated in September 2023, establishes non-excessive
prices for drugs launched in the period between the coming into force of the amendments and the
adoption of new guidelines.
The PMPRB has indicated its intention to launch an iterative consultation process conducted in stages
with stakeholders with an aim to develop new Guidelines in 2024
STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH (HESA) – STUDY ON PMPRB
On March 9, 2023, HESA adopted a motion to conduct a study on the Patented Medicine Prices Review
Board and invite the following witnesses: the Honourable Jean-Yves Duclos, Minister of Health; Matthew
Herder, former member of the PMPRB; Mélanie Bourassa Forcier, former acting chair, PMPRB; and
Douglas Clark, former executive director, PMPRB.
The study took place on April 27 and May 2, 2023, with the requested witnesses making opening
statements and answering questions.
On May 4, 2023, HESA passed a motion that witnesses produce correspondence they considered
relevant to support their testimony to the committee, which have since been published on the
committee website.
It is expected that the committee will report its findings and recommendations to the House and request
that the government table a comprehensive response to the report.
ISSUE SHEET – CHA COMPLIANCE/ABORTION ACCESS
USE OF PRIVATE FACILITIES FOR DELIVERY OF INSURED SERVICES
Under the Canada Health Act, medically necessary hospital and physician services may be provided in
private facilities, so long as patients are not charged to access care.
Several PTs have been expanding the use of private facilities to deliver medically necessary services to
address the service backlogs.
PTs have used private facilities to deliver medically necessary services since the 1990’s and have various
mechanisms in place to ensure patients are not charged for their care.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
DEDUCTIONS AND REIMBURSEMENTS FROM CHT PAYMENTS FOR PATIENT CHARGES
Since 2015, the Government of Canada has levied close to $188 million in mandatory CHT deductions to
jurisdictions that allow patient charges for insured health services.
In March 2023, BC, ON, and NB faced mandatory CHT deductions for patient charges for insured health
care services provided in private facilities and BC, AB, SK, MB, QC, NB, and NS faced mandatory
deductions for insured diagnostic services received in private facilities (under the Diagnostic Services
Policy).
Deductions are generally based on amounts of patient charges reported by PTs on an annual basis to HC.
If there is evidence that a PT has not reported accurately HC is required to estimate the amount of
patient charges, based on the best evidence available.
HC was required to take deductions based on estimates for AB, SK, MB, QC, NB, and NS.
Regarding patient charges for diagnostic services, BC reported accurately to HC and a deduction in the
same amount was levied from the province’s CHT.
PTs are eligible for reimbursement within two years of the date of deduction under the CHA’s
Reimbursement Policy if they choose to work with HC on a Reimbursement Action Plan and take the
necessary steps to eliminate patient charges, and the circumstances that led to them. The first
deductions eligible for reimbursement under the policy were those taken in March 2018 and since then
$84,938,117 in deductions have been reimbursed to provinces as a result of their efforts to eliminate
patient charges and the circumstances that led to them.
FOR ABORTION SERVICES
NEW BRUNSWICK
Deductions: $334,766 since March 2020. Reimbursements: None to date.
Issue: Surgical abortion services are only insured under the NB health insurance plan if performed in
hospital; procedures provided in the private clinic in Fredericton are not covered.
Status: HC has raised this issue with NB at the officials' and Ministerial levels with no resolution to date.
ONTARIO
Deductions: $53,265 since March 2021. Reimbursements: Reimbursement Action Plan submitted
December 2021 but no reimbursements to date.
Issue: A number of private abortion clinics in ON charge fees for uninsured services, while not
consistently informing patients these fees were optional to access insured surgical abortion services.
Status: HC continues to engage with ON as they work to implement their Reimbursement Action Plan.
FOR SURGICAL SERVICES

HEALTH CARE FUNDING
On February 7, 2023, the Government of Canada announced an investment of close to $200 billion over
10 years, including $46.2 billion in new funding for provinces and territories to improve health care
services for Canadians; and, is committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure these
investments are used in ways that respect the principles of the Canada Health Act.
ISSUE SHEET – ALCOHOL
TRENDS IN ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
In 2019, close to 80% of Canadians reported drinking alcohol in the past year.
Unchanged from 2017, slightly more males (78%) than females (75%) reported alcohol use in 2019.
The prevalence of past-12-month alcohol use among youth aged 15 to 19 steadily decreased from 57% in
2017 to 46% in 2019. There was no change among adults aged 20 and older.
In 2021, almost 5.1 million or 15.6% of people in Canada aged 12 and over engaged in heavy drinking.
On a volume basis, sales of alcohol declined by 1.2% in 2021-2022, representing the first decline since
2013/2014 and the largest decrease in over a decade.
IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
There was a 10% increase in hospitalizations due to alcohol consumption in Canada from the pre-
pandemic period (2019) to the pandemic period (March 2020 to June 2021).
In January 2021, when asked about their drinking behaviours, 24% of respondents reported increased
alcohol use since the start of the pandemic.
Close to one in five Canadians (21%) consumed five or more drinks on the days they had consumed
alcohol in the previous month – higher than what was recorded before the pandemic.
From 2019 to 2020, Canada experienced an 18% increase in alcohol-attributed deaths. This represents
the largest year-over-year increase in over 20 years.
ALCOHOL-RELATED HARMS
In 2020, there were over 17,000 alcohol-related deaths and 650,000 emergency room hospital visits
related to alcohol in Canada.
In 2019, of those who reported past-year alcohol use, 21% (4.8 million) experienced at least one alcohol-
related harm.
The economic burden of alcohol use in Canada was estimated to be greater than $19 billion, with $6.3
billion of that sum spent on health care.
Alcohol is the most used psychoactive substance in Canada and is a leading risk factor for over 200
diseases and conditions, including liver disease, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder , cardiovascular disease,
and seven types of cancer (mouth, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, liver, colon, and breast).
Long term alcohol consumption, even at low levels, can lead to health issues.
The latest scientific evidence no longer supports the claim that drinking alcohol may have any health
benefits.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
$1.5 million to the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) to update alcohol guidance
(Canada’s Guidance on Alcohol and Health, formerly Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines).
Support CCSA to undertake the Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms study, which estimates how
different substances impact Canada’s health and criminal justice systems, and the productivity of people
in Canada.
Support the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR) to assess the implementation of
federal and provincial evidence-based alcohol policies through the Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation
project ($734,119)
Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program currently funds 22 active alcohol-related and
polysubstance use projects including:
3 Managed Alcohol Programs: Boyle Street Non-Residential Managed Alcohol Program ($854,701 plus
amendment of $461,832), the St. John’s Status of Women Council Harm Reduction Project for Women
($575,930 plus amendment of $286,765), and the Unity Health Toronto (St. Michael’s Hospital)
Implementation of a Managed Alcohol Program ($257,452).
$3.3 million to the CISUR to operate a pilot program that will evaluate a cannabis substitution
intervention as a component of a Managed Alcohol Programs.
Support for WHO’s Global Alcohol Action Plan with an objective to accelerate and strengthen the
implementation of the Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful use of Alcohol.
PHAC’s surveillance activities with respect to maternal and child health issues due to alcohol use .
Canadian Institutes of Health Research supports alcohol research to inform policies and interventions
through Alcohol Catalyst Grants ($2 million in 2021).
Launch of the Public Awareness of Alcohol-related Harms Survey to determine Canadians’ knowledge
and awareness of alcohol risks and harms.
NATIONAL GUIDELINE ON THE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF HIGH-RISK DRINKING AND ALCOHOL USE
DISORDER
On October 16, 2023, the British Columbia Centre for Substance Use released the first national clinical
guideline for the management of high-risk alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorder.
Health Canada is reviewing the clinical guideline.
Supplementary resources related to the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy will also be developed
and are anticipated to be available in the coming months.
CANADA’S GUIDANCE ON ALCOHOL AND HEALTH
In January 2023, CCSA released Canada’s Guidance on Alcohol and Health, which provides updated and
evidence-based information on the risks and harms associated with alcohol use.
Health Canada has studied the recommendations of the CCSA and is funding CCSA to engage Canadians
on knowledge translation and dissemination tools and the best way to communicate the risks of alcohol
consumption with people across Canada. This is important to ensure that the unique circumstances of
people with diverse backgrounds and personal experiences are taken into account as part of addressing
alcohol and substance use in Canada.
CCSA’s new Guidance is part of ongoing discussions with stakeholders to determine the best approaches
to communicating information about the risks of alcohol consumption to the public, including people
with lived experience of alcohol use, health care providers, public health and professionals, policymakers
and Indigenous Peoples.
ALCOHOL LABELLING
Alcohol beverages are required to carry certain labeling such as common name, net quantity, and
language requirements .
CCSA’s Canada’s Guidance on Alcohol and Health report contains policy recommendations for labelling
alcoholic beverages, including the number of standard drinks in a container and health warnings.
Health Canada has studied the recommendations and is funding CCSA to engage Canadians on
knowledge translation and dissemination tools and to inform its approach on the best way to
communicate the risks of alcohol.
Alcohol labelling is recommended by the World Health Organization as an effective intervention when
introduced as part of a suite of policy initiatives, such as taxation and pricing, to increase awareness of
alcohol consumption.
Some countries are beginning to introduce alcohol warning labels to provide health and other
information at the point of sale. Health Canada will continue to monitor international activities on
labelling and seek opportunities to engage Canadians on how to better inform the public about alcohol-
related harms.
Health Canada is monitoring Bill S-254: An Act to Amend the Food and Drugs Act, which calls for the
federal government to mandate warning labels on alcoholic beverages, as it proceeds through the
parliamentary process.

From 2016 to 2022, in youth (0-19), the total number of opioid and stimulant-related poisoning
hospitalizations among females was consistently higher compared to their male counterparts (1,192
compared to 863, respectively, from 2016-2022). From January to March of 2023, the number was
similar among both males and females aged 0-19 (35 and 32, respectively).
Data points to people commonly dying of overdoses alone and mostly indoors. In Ontario, from March to
December of 2020, 73% of fatal overdoses occurred where no one was present to intervene. In BC, in
2022, 83% of fatal overdoses occurred indoors, more specifically, 55% occurred in private residences.
Majority (86%) of accidental opioid toxicity deaths in 2022 occurred in: BC, AB, ON
DECLARATION OF EMERGENCIES
Some jurisdictions (provincial, territorial, municipal, First Nations communities) have declared different
types of emergencies related to substance use. These declarations have varying levels of legal
implications, depending on the type of jurisdiction, type of emergency declared, and legislative context
of the declaration. For example, British Columbia’s public health emergency, declared under the
provincial Public Health Act, allows for more robust data collection, whereas Yukon’s substance use
health emergency declaration was intended as a commitment to respond and a call to action.

During the first nine months of the pandemic (March-December 2020), among First Nations populations,
opioid-related deaths increased by 132% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. There was only a
68% increase among non-First Nations people.
IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
Compared to the two-year period before the pandemic (April 2018 – March 2020, 9,470 hospitalizations)
there was a 24 percent increase in opioid-related poisoning hospitalizations in Canada during the first
two years of the pandemic (April 2020 – March 2022, 11,765 hospitalizations).
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
Since 2017, guided by the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy (CDSS), the Government of Canada
has taken urgent action to address the overdose crisis and made significant investments of over $1
billion, which includes $359.2 million announced through Budget 2023 to support a renewed CDSS. Our
approach recognizes that a full continuum of strategies is necessary to address substance use-related
harms and the overdose crisis and includes efforts to:
improve access to treatment services;
increase access to harm reduction services, including supervised consumption sites;
support a range of innovative approaches to harm reduction, treatment, and prevention at the
community level;
strengthen law enforcement capacity to address illegal drug production and trafficking;
increase awareness and prevention efforts; and,
build the evidence base through investments in research and surveillance.
On February 7, 2023, the Government of Canada announced it will increase health funding to provinces
and territories by nearly $200 billion over 10 years, in order to improve Canada’s health care system. This
investment includes $25 billion for shared health priorities, including increasing access to mental health
and substance use services and supports. These commitments are in addition to existing bilateral
agreements with provinces and territories for health priorities, including $5 billion over 10 years for
Mental Health and Addictions that were put in place in 2017. These investments will set the foundation
for long-term, integrated and sustained health care system change that builds on existing, targeted
actions to address substance use-related harms and the overdose crisis.
SAFER SUPPLY
As of October 2023, Health Canada is currently supporting 29 safer supply pilot projects across Canada
through the Substance Use and Addictions Program, representing total funding commitments of over
$97 million.
We are seeing some promising early outcomes from safer supply.
These include reduced emergency department visits and hospitalizations. We are also hearing reports
from safer supply clients across multiple programs of reduced overdoses, illegal drug use, and criminal
activity.
Some providers and clients have described additional benefits, such as improvements in social
functioning, health and mental health, access to housing and income supports, and the time and stability
needed to pursue personal goals.
We will continue to monitor outcomes of safer supply, so that our response to the overdose crisis is
evidence-based and focussed on saving lives.
We are also aware of some concerns, such as diversion, and are committed to taking action where
necessary.
Diversion of drugs from safer supply programs is illegal.
Drugs containing controlled substances, including those used in safer supply programs, are subject to the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and its regulations. This includes laws and regulations
around storage, transport, and measures to help prevent diversion.
Health Canada supports law enforcement actions to address drug trafficking and support community
safety, wherever it takes place.
We will continue to evaluate all available and emerging evidence in regard to safer supply programs to
understand the potential benefits and risks.

HESA SUPPS C BACKGROUNDER – PHARMACEUTICAL LITIGATION
BC CLASS ACTIONS
In August 2018, BC commenced a proposed class action lawsuit against 50 opioid manufacturers and
distributors for allegedly acting inappropriately in the sale and distribution of opioids in Canada. BC’s
Notice of Claim indicates that the action is brought on behalf of all federal, provincial and territorial
governments. The next major step will be BC’s application to certify this proposed class action lawsuit in
the BC Supreme Court which has been scheduled for four weeks beginning on November 27, 2023.
In December 2021, BC also commenced a proposed class action against McKinsey & Company on behalf
of all Canadian governments. In this action, BC alleges in its Notice of Claim that McKinsey & Company
acted inappropriately in the course of providing consulting and advisory services to opioid
manufacturers and distributors in Canada. The certification hearing set for February 2024 will likely be
postponed.
OPIOIDS RECOVERY LEGISLATION
In October 2018, BC passed the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act to support its legal
action. This legislation creates a statutory cause of action and right for BC to recover from opioid
manufacturers and distributors opioid related health care costs incurred by the BC government. As of
October 24, 2023, all P/Ts with the exception of the Yukon have introduced or passed their own opioids
recovery legislation.
On November 4, 2022, BC amended its legislation to include a statutory right for Canada to recover
opioid related damages incurred by Canada in BC. As of October 24, 2023, both Quebec and Nova Scotia
have included a similar statutory right for Canada to recover opioid related damages incurred by Canada
in their respective jurisdictions. This is an example of the significant cooperation that exists between the
Provinces and Territories and the Government of Canada as they work together to address the overdose
crisis.
REGULATORY STANDPOINT
The Protecting Canadians from Unsafe Drugs Act (also known as Vanessa’s Law), received Royal Assent
on November 6, 2014. This legislation, which amended the Food and Drugs Act, strengthened Health
Canada’s safety oversight of therapeutic products by giving the regulator increased authorities to collect
post-market safety information and take appropriate action when a serious health risk is identified.
These amendments also introduce important new transparency measures which will ensure that
Canadians have timely access to drug safety information. Together, these amendments will lead to
improved patient safety and better health outcomes for Canadians.
The Food and Drugs Act was also amended in 2014 to increase the penalties available upon conviction
for a contravention of the advertising provisions, including when any person makes false and misleading
statements. The maximum penalty is now up to $5 million per offence. These amendments required
manufacturers to comply with any terms and conditions (T&Cs) on authorizations for drugs and medical
devices imposed by the Minister. Following regulatory amendments in 2018, the Minister of Health has
imposed T&Cs on prescription opioid products in Part B of the List of Opioids.
These T&Cs for prescription opioids include the requirement that manufacturers must seek review from
an independent advertising preclearance agency (APA) recognized by Health Canada for all materials
directed to healthcare professionals. This APA review determines whether the materials are
promotional, and if so, whether they respect the terms of market authorization. Additionally, all
advertising materials of prescription opioids provided to health care professionals must only include
verbatim statements contained in the Canadian Product Monograph and must fairly balance statements
about benefits and risks. The T&Cs also require manufacturers to develop and implement Risk
Management Plans for prescription opioids with proactive activities to monitor and mitigate opioid
harms in Canada.
In addition to T&Cs, the Food and Drug Regulations were amended in 2018 to strengthen information
provided to patients by pharmacists by using patient information handouts and warning stickers.
Currently, Health Canada is working on regulatory proposals to extend the Minister’s authority to impose
and amend terms and conditions on authorizations at any time for all drugs and medical devices. The
draft regulations were pre-published in the Canada Gazette Part 1 on December 17, 2022.
HESA SUPPS C BACKGROUNDER – STRENGTHENING THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF NATURAL HEALTH
PRODUCTS
NATURAL HEALTH PRODUCTS
There are nearly 200,000 different natural health products (NHPs) in Canadian stores, representing a $5
billion per year industry in Canada.
Many Canadians use these products (like vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies, and even some
sunscreens) every day, sometimes multiple times per day, to care for themselves and their families.
STRENGTHENING THE REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OF NATURAL HEALTH PRODUCTS
(why changes to the NHP program are needed now)
While natural health products are generally lower risk, that does not mean they are without risk.
Health Canada has seen serious non-compliance that could potentially be harmful to consumers, such as
product contamination and the presence of ingredients not listed on the label.
In 2021: A pilot program using proactive monitoring of natural health products advertising found non-
compliant cancer claims among 63% (2070) of the over 3800 advertisements identified through an
enhanced artificial intelligence tool.
In 2021 and 2022: A pilot inspection program found high levels of non-compliance with regulatory
requirements for good manufacturing practices. Issues were identified at all 36 natural health products
manufacturers and importers inspected, ranging in severity.
From 2021 to 2023: 100 voluntary recalls of licensed natural health products conducted for safety issues,
including bacterial contamination and presence of foreign matter such as fibreglass.
These findings support the need to educate industry about its regulatory obligations as well as to
increase oversight of the industry.
In 2021, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development completed an audit of the
natural health product program and reported gaps in the regulatory oversight of these products. In
response, Health Canada committed to undertaking a number of activities to improve the safety of these
products.
FEDERAL ACTIONS
Health Canada’s initiatives will support access to safe and high quality NHPs. These regulatory changes
are not about removing choice or reducing access.
Improved NHP labelling
In July 2022, Health Canada introduced new regulatory requirements to make natural health product
labels easier for Canadians to read and understand and address concerns about small font sizes and
missing or unclear safety information. This includes, for example, increased font size and improved
colour contrast.
To support industry in implementing these changes, there is a multi-year transition period (up to six
years) ending June 2028.
Vanessa’s Law Powers
In June 2023, the Government passed legislation allowing Health Canada to take more action if a serious
risk to health is identified with a natural health product. This legislative change allows Health Canada to
order a recall of a product or add warnings on labels to support safe use, if necessary, which it couldn’t
do before.
Since 2018, companies have conducted approximately 300 voluntary NHP recalls, as Health Canada did
not have the authority to order mandatory recalls.
These new authorities will only need to be used if a serious risk to health is identified and a company
refuses to partake in voluntary mechanisms.
Cost Recovery Fee Proposal
Now, Health Canada is proposing fees for industry to allow the Department to create an even safer
marketplace for consumers — one that will support the access of safe and high quality natural health
products.
The fee revenues would enable Health Canada to strengthen its oversight of NHPs, monitor labelling and
advertising, and put in place a permanent inspection program.
Presently, NHPs are the only line of health products whose regulatory activities are fully funded by
Canadian taxpayers.
Health Canada knows that many NHP companies are small businesses and is committed to supporting
them. The Department is considering measures to help alleviate the impact of fees on businesses. This
includes fee reductions for small businesses of 25% to 50% and a full waiver of pre-market evaluation
fees for small businesses marketing their first product. The Department is actively reviewing thousands
of comments received on its fee proposal, including the fee reduction for small businesses, as part of an
open and transparent consultation process.
Health Canada is presently considering how best to adjust its fee proposal based on the comments
received from stakeholders prior to further engagement.
ISSUE SHEET- CHILDREN’S HEALTH
UNICEF Report Cards
Canada ranks 30th among 38 other high income countries in the well-being of children and youth
(UNICEF Report Card). Conversely, Canada ranks among the countries with the best economic,
environmental and social conditions for growing up, but the poorest outcomes for children and youth.
This result is driven in part by the intersection of the well-being outcomes of mental health, physical
health, and educational and skill development. Notably, Canada has one of the highest rates of
adolescent suicide, ranking 35th out of 38.
Undersized Children’s Healthcare System
Children are often waiting longer than adults for critical health services.
In Ontario as of July 2023:
2/3 of patients at Ontario's children's hospitals have passed recommended wait times for surgery
90,000 children and youth are waiting for community and school-based development and rehabilitation
services
The situation is similar in other provinces. For example, in Nova Scotia 2,500 pediatric patients are
waiting for surgery, with 40% waiting beyond the recommended window.
Experts are concerned by the insufficient number of specialized healthcare providers relative to the
population of children:
In 2020, there were 74 practicing pediatric surgeons in Canada.
The median distance to the closest pediatric surgeon was 28km, with 22.7% (1.7 million or nearly 25%)
of all Canadian children living more than 100km from surgical care.
In 2019, there were 2973 pediatric physicians working in Canada, that is 8 physicians per 100,000
children and youth.
Rural and Remote Communities
In 2020, just over 14% of Canadians 12 years and over lacked a regular health care provider, with major
data gaps for children under 12 .
These gaps are even larger for Canadian children living in rural and remote communities:
1 in 5 Canadians live in rural communities yet, only 8% of physicians and 3% of psychiatrists practicing in
Canada serve these communities.
In 2020-2021, children living in rural and remote communities were more likely to visit the emergency
department and to be hospitalized for mental health than children living in urban areas.
Mental Health of Children and Youth
Almost two thirds of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25, and nearly half do before 18.
Younger Canadians are among the highest users of Emergency Departments (ED) for mental health and
substance use services. In 2020, over 35,000 children and youth were hospitalized for mental health
disorders – almost 1 in 4 of all hospitalizations for children and youth.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the mental health of youth. The percentage of
youth aged 12 to 17 years reporting “excellent” or “very good” mental health fell from 72% in 2019 to
69% in 2020 and was even lower in 2021 (62%).
Disproportionally Affected Children
First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children face unique barriers in healthcare stemming from generations of
racism, discrimination and trauma. For example, they face higher rates of infant mortality and higher
poverty rates.
Black youth and children also face unique barriers in healthcare. They tend to wait longer for mental
health treatment compared to other populations in Canada, Black youth are more likely to be diagnosed
with major depressive disorder (MDD), and are six times more likely to die by suicide due to their
depression than White youth.
There was a 286% increase in reports of racist and discriminatory actions against Asian children in 2021
compared with data from 2020.
In Canada, approximately 7 in 10 youth aged 15- 17 years old experience bullying
Evidence shows that Indigenous youth, adolescents from low socioeconomic status, and sexually and
gender-diverse youth are more often the target of identity-based bullying.
Federal Action
Funding
Budget 2023 lays out the federal government’s plan, “Working Together to Improve Health Care for
Canadians,” to provide nearly $200 billion in additional funding over ten years to provinces and
territories.
Through the Government’s plan, we continue to work closely with provinces and territories on our
shared health priorities, including:
Access to family health services,
Supported health workers and reduced backlogs,
Access to mental health and substance use services, and
Modernizing health systems
The plan further provided an immediate unconditional $2 billion Canada Health Transfer (CHT) top-up to
address immediate pressures on health care systems, especially in pediatric hospitals, emergency rooms
and wait times for surgeries.
Mental Health Initiatives
In April 2020, in response to the pandemic, the Government launched Wellness Together Canada (WTC),
an online mental health and substance use portal. Through it, children and youth (ages 5 to 29) can
access free resources, including Kids Help Phone.
The Government of Canada is taking action by providing support for Integrated Youth Services,
developing national standards for mental health and substance use services, advancing development of
the 988 suicide prevention hotline and announced in budget 2022, $100 million in additional funding to
support harm reduction, treatment, and prevention related to the opioid crisis at the community level.
Data Initiatives
The Government of Canada is working collaboratively with children’s health leaders to address significant
data gaps through the establishment of ongoing monitoring mechanisms to obtain timely information on
pediatric health system capacity and utilization moving forward, including bed and ventilator utilization
and capacity to be in a better position to anticipate and react to the surges.
Statistics Canada is currently running a second cycle of the Canadian Health Survey on Children and
Youth (CHSCY) to explore issues that have an impact on the physical and mental health of children and
youth, including mental health, childhood experiences, suicidal thoughts, substance use and impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the upcoming next cycle of the CHSCY, significant emphasis has been placed on the mental well-being
of children and youth, which is a priority for the federal government. Indicators related to mental health
include suicidal thoughts, emotional behaviour, access to mental health care when needed, sexual
attraction, distress.
HESA Study on Children’s Health
The Standing Committee on Health (HESA) passed a motion on February 9, 2022 to undertake a study on
children’s health and the impact of the pandemic on children’s health outcomes. The Standing
Committee on Health completed this study in the spring of 2023 and a report is expected shortly. The
Government of Canada looks forward to reviewing the committee recommendations.
ISSUE SHEET – WOMEN’S HEALTH
ISSUE:
Women, trans and non-binary people experience poorer health from missed diagnoses, minimized
symptoms, greater burdens of specific diseases, and poorly targeted treatment compared to men. In
Canada, women’s health care – as a field of research and program implementation – remains under-
researched and under-developed in key areas. The Government of |Canada has already begun the work
to better prioritize women’s health issues.
CANCER AND CHRONIC ILLNESSES
Since 2007, Health Canada has consistently funded the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) with
approximately $50 million/year, with a particular focus on addressing women’s cancers, including breast
and cervical cancers, alongside other objectives.
Cancer statistics tell us there has been an annual decline of -1.2% in cancer incidence among women
since 2011, reflecting positive trends in cancer prevention and management.
Budget 2016 earmarked $5 million over 5 years to support targeted research on women’s heart and
vascular diseases through the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.
Budget 2019 committed $10 million over 5 years to Ovarian Cancer Canada to bridge gaps in knowledge
about effective prevention, screening, and treatment options for ovarian cancer. Stakeholders point out
that the need for more substantial research investments is crucial to drive significant improvements in
outcomes compared to the 1990s.
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
Health Canada’s Sexual and Reproductive Health Fund was created in 2021 to advance mandate
commitments. Budget 2021 and 2023 allocated $81 million over six years to the Sexual and Reproductive
Health Fund (SRHF) to improve access to SRH care for various groups.
The SRHF projects cover abortion, 2SLGBTQ+, Indigenous, and endometriosis issues.
Quebec also received $9.7 million for community-based organizations.
The Government is investing $7.6 million over five years in Statistics Canada for the Sexual and
Reproductive Health Data Initiative to gather evidence, filling information gaps, and guiding sexual and
reproductive health support for Canadians.
Health portfolio partners also support research, gender-disaggregated inequalities data collection, and
sexual and reproductive health data collection, among others areas.
MENTAL HEALTH
Young women and girls are disproportionately affected by mental health concerns as compared to their
male peers.
The Government acknowledges the sixth Report of the Standing Committee on the Status of Women,
emphasizing the interconnected factors influencing young women’s mental health, and allocated $200
billion in Budget 2023 to improve health care services for Canadians, including reporting through data
disaggregation to provide more insight into women’s healthcare experiences.
Online counselling and peer support services are available to young women directly through Kids Help
Phone and other organizations (Youthspace; Jack.org; BounceBack offered through CMHA), as well as
through provincial and territorial services such as Tel-Jeunes in Quebec, and Alberta’s COVID-19 Youth
Mental Health Resource Hub.
Perinatal Mental Health
On March 9, 2022, a ministerial roundtable was held to discuss perinatal mental health care access.
The government is funding Women’s College Hospital to create an evidence-based National Clinical
Practice Guideline for Perinatal Mental Illness, based on input from experts, providers, and those with
lived experience.
SUBSTANCE USE
Data has shown that in Canada, a significant proportion of women use substances.
Between 2016-2022, women made up 26-30% of all opioid related deaths, and 38-50% of opioid-related
hospitalizations.
In 2022, First Nations women died at 11.2 times the rate of non-Indigenous women from an overdose.
Between September 2020 and December 2020, 16.2% of women self-reported an increase in their
alcohol consumption.
In 2018-19, 18% of high school female students reported cannabis use.
HEALTH RESEARCH AND FUNDING (PHAC & CIHR)
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) is investing $20 million over 5 years in the National
Women’s Health Research Initiative (NWHRI).
NWHRI focuses on under-researched and high-priority areas of women’s health.
NWHRI conducts research in cancer, endometriosis, and mental health, emphasizing an inclusive
approach to research.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)’s Healthy Canadians and Communities Fund (HCCF) invests
approximately $20 million per year in women’s health projects.
HCCF funds projects to support women’s health in:
Cardiovascular disease prevention
Peer health coaching for chronic disease risk factors
Diabetes and obesity prevention for Indigenous women
Increasing physical activity and literacy among women and girls
BREAST IMPLANTS
The Standing Committee on Health (HESA) conducted an examination into the viability of establishing a
comprehensive breast implant registry. This process involved the active participation of Health Canada as
a witness, which took place in April 2023
Subsequent meetings occurred in May 2023 further delving into the subject matter. However, as of
October 2023, the release of the committee’s report remains pending
The idea of creating a breast implant registry has been an ongoing topic of discussion across various
platforms, including media coverage, previous deliberations at HESA, advocacy by medical professionals,
patient advocates, and individuals with direct experiences, as well as consultations at the Health Canada
Scientific Advisory Committee on Health Products for Women.
It’s noteworthy that while registries are commonly employed to facilitate research, they are not typically
used as a mean of monitoring the safety of medical devices. In Canada, there is currently only one
known medical device registry, managed by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI),
primarily intended for research purposes to inform clinical practices.
Health Canada actively reviews and monitors breast implants, taking actions when necessary, but it
doesn’t provide medical advice or maintain an individual-specific implant registry.
Health Canada actively monitors and takes actions on breast implant safety but does not maintain a
patient-specific implant database.
OTHER FEDERAL INITIATIVES
Through transfer payments, funding is also provided to organizations such as the Native Women's
Association of Canada and Les Femmes Michif Otipemisiwak to address issues as diverse as oral health
care and medical assistance in dying, or such as projects under the Substance Use and Addictions
Program for women of diverse backgrounds who have lived experience with substance use.
HESA BACKGROUNDER – BREAST IMPLANTS
BREAST IMPLANTS – KEY FACTS
Breast implants are regulated as Class IV devices under the Medical Devices Regulations, which means
that they undergo the highest level of review for safety, effectiveness and quality before they may be
sold in Canada.
Breast implants are used to increase breast size, modify or adjust breast unevenness or appearance, or
to reconstruct breasts after a surgical procedure such as a mastectomy (breast removal).
Most breast implant surgical procedures occur in private health care institutions (about 85%).
Health Canada monitors the safety of all medical devices once authorized. This monitoring has informed
a number of actions for breast implants, including suspending the licence for breast implants posing a
higher risk of developing a rare form of cancer, and working with manufacturers to implement
comprehensive labelling changes to support informed decision-making.
BREAST IMPLANT REGISTRY – KEY FACTS
Discussions regarding the creation of a registry include important privacy considerations and involve
health authorities and organisations, including provincial and territorial governments, since health
treatments and follow-ups are under P/T jurisdiction.
One key challenge to establishing a breast implant registry would be the requirement for health data
from private health care institutions.
No single organization is best placed to lead the development of a breast implant registry.
HEALTH CANADA ACTIONS
Health Canada has completed multiple post-market safety reviews of breast implants which have led to
risk mitigation actions.
In 2017, 2019, and 2022, Health Canada published safety reviews online on the risk of breast implant
associated-anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL).
Breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin
lymphoma that can develop next to the implant.
In 2019, Health Canada suspended the medical device authorization for Allergan Biocell macro-textured
breast implants due to an increased risk of developing BIA-ALCL.
In addition, Health Canada also worked with manufacturers to implement comprehensive labelling
changes, including a boxed warning and patient decision checklists.
Health Canada has published information in a variety of formats, including a comprehensive webpage on
breast implants; a data blog updated annually which outlines findings of BIA-ALCL in Canada; and social
media posts on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
The Department has also introduced a subscription service to inform interested Canadians about Health
Canada publications on breast implants. Subscribers (who can be health professionals, people with
breast implants, researchers, etc.) are alerted whenever Health Canada publishes new information on
breast implants, including: general information; safety or recall information; risk communications; and
updates to the Public Health Infobase data blog and breast implant webpages.
CONSIDERATIONS FOR A BREAST IMPLANT REGISTRY
The concept of a breast implant registry has been discussed since 2005: in the media; at HESA; by
physician and patient advocates, including people with lived/living experience; and at the Health Canada
Scientific Advisory Committee on Health Products for Women.
While registries are often used to support research, they are not a common mechanism to monitor the
safety of medical devices.
Currently there is only one medical device registry in Canada.
The Canadian Joint Replacement Registry for hip and knee prostheses is managed by the Canadian
Institute for Health Information (CIHI) and used for research purposes to inform clinical practice.
In March 2023, Health Canada, along with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) and Women
and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE) as federal partners, participated in a Best Brains Exchange (BBE)
meeting that examined the development of a registry to capture nation-wide information about the
effects of breast implants on an ongoing manner.
International and domestic stakeholders from across the healthcare ecosystem participated in the
discussion.
The discussion highlighted the complexities of a breast implant registry.
Manufacturers, regulatory agencies and health care professionals all have a role to play in the safety of
medical devices.
A national breast implant registry would require a high degree of coordination and its benefits would
only be fully realized if all partners in the healthcare system were to adopt it and if all people with breast
implants were to enroll in it.
ISSUE SHEET – CANNABIS
CANNABIS USE AND FREQUENCY AMONG CANADIANS (AGED 16+)
Past 30-day cannabis use in 2022 (19%) increased from 2018 (15%) and 2021 (17%)
In 2022, past 30-day cannabis use remained higher among males (21%, an increase from 19% in 2018)
than among females (16%, an increase from 11% in 2018)
In 2022, 25% of those who reported using cannabis in the past 12 months reported using cannabis daily
or almost daily, unchanged from 25% in 2018, and unchanged between 2021 (26%) and 2022
CANNABIS USE AND FREQUENCY AMONG YOUTH (16-19) AND YOUNG ADULTS (20-24)
In 2022, past 30-day cannabis use remained higher among Canadians aged 16-19 years (25%, unchanged
from 23% in 2018) and 20-24 years (36%, an increase from 30% in 2018) than among people age 25+
(17%, an increase from 13% in 2018)
DISPLACEMENT OF THE ILLICIT MARKET
The legal cannabis market continues to displace the illicit market. According to Statistics Canada data,
the legal share of the value of cannabis consumed has steadily increased to 72% in the second quarter of
2023, compared to just 9% prior to legalization
In 2022, 61% of those who used cannabis in the past 12 months indicated their usual source of cannabis
was a legal storefront, an increase from 52% in 2021
In 2022, 8% of those who used cannabis in the past 12 months indicated a legal online source as their
usual source of cannabis, a decrease from 11% in 2021
MEDICAL ACCESS FRAMEWORK
As of June 30, 2023, there were 203,933 patients registered with federally licensed sellers (Note: these
are not always unique individuals as individuals may be registered with more than one licensed seller,
provided an original medical document was used with each registration)
As of July 31, 2023, there were more than 16,507 individuals registered with Health Canada for personal
and designated production of cannabis for their own medical purposes
As of August 31, 2023, Health Canada has refused or revoked over 2,300 registrations under the
Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations, including over 1,700 for reasons of public health and public
safety
The number of individuals currently registered with the Personal and Designated Production program is
the lowest since the Act came into force.
The majority of medical access patients are purchasing cannabis from federally licensed sellers rather
than growing under personal and designated production.
CANNABIS ACT LEGISLATIVE REVIEW
On September 22, 2022, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Mental Health and Addictions
announced the launch of the legislative review of the Cannabis Act, and appointed an independent
Expert Panel to lead the review.
The Panel has consulted extensively with the cannabis industry to better understand the impacts of the
cannabis legislative framework and the challenges and opportunities that exist within the sector. They
have also met with the public, other orders of government, people who access cannabis for medical
purposes, youth, marginalized and racialized communities, Indigenous communities and organizations,
and public health experts.
The feedback will not only inform the Panel’s final report and the formulation of their advice and
recommendations, but it will also help inform Health Canada’s ongoing efforts to improve the operation
and administration of Canada’s cannabis control framework.
The review is currently underway and the Expert Panel is continuing to seek input from the public,
stakeholders, Indigenous groups, and expert organizations.
The Expert Panel published a What We Heard report on October 10th, 2023, which summarizes the
input heard during their extensive stakeholder engagements to date.
The Expert Panel’s final report will be tabled in Parliament by the Minister of Health at the end of the 18-
month legislative review period (I.e., by March 22, 2024).
While the legislative review is underway, Health Canada will continue to examine regulatory measures
that could be made more efficient and streamlined, reducing the burden on industry, without
compromising public health and public safety.
ISSUE SHEET – MENTAL HEALTH
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE OF CANADIANS
Population mental health and needs in Canada
Positive self-rated mental health has declined in parallel with an increase in mood and anxiety disorders.
In 2022, nearly 1 in 5 met the diagnostic criteria for a mood, anxiety or substance use disorder, reflecting
more than 5 million people in Canada.
Nearly one in five Canadians reported a need for mental health care in 2020.
44% of those who had a need reported that their needs were either unmet or only partially met.
The highest needs are among youth, particularly women aged 15-24, Indigenous Peoples, those in the
2SLGBTQI+ community, and those facing complex needs such as concurrent disorders.
Concurrent disorders
People with a mental illness are twice as likely to have a substance use disorder compared to the general
population, with at least 20% of people with a mental illness having a co-occurring substance use
disorder.
For people with schizophrenia, this number may be as high as 50%.
People with substance use disorders are up to three times more likely to have a mental illness. For
example, 50% of those in substance use treatment also experience mental illness.
Homelessness and complex needs
Since 2020, more than 34 communities across Canada have publicly announced crises or emergencies or
have publicly declared a need for additional government supports related to the intersecting issues of
mental illness, substance use, and homelessness. These communities include urban centres, Indigenous
communities, and rural populations.
The rate of homelessness has increased by 20% in Canada since 2018, with unsheltered homelessness
doubling during that time, according to INFC.
The prevalence of mental disorders, including substance use disorders, is up to 76% in homeless
populations of high income countries, including Canada.
Based on INFC Point in Time counts, 60% self-report mental illness, and 61% self-report substance use
disorders.
Mental health and substance use issues are both pathways to and consequences of homelessness, and
can increase challenges in exiting from homelessness.
Indigenous peoples
In 2021, only half of Indigenous peoples in Canada reported excellent or very good mental health.
In the same year, 17% of Indigenous Peoples in Canada had unmet needs for mental health care.
Indigenous peoples experience disproportionate rates of suicide, homelessness, and substance use
harms in comparison to non-Indigenous peoples in Canada.
The suicide rate (2011-2016) among First Nations people (24.3 deaths per 100,000) was three times
higher than the rate among non-Indigenous people (8.0 deaths per 100,000) according to a 2019
Statistics Canada report.
Indigenous peoples represent 39% of shelter users, but comprise 5% of the Canadian population,
according to INFC.
In Alberta, First Nations people represent approximately 6% of the population, yet they represented 22%
of all opioid poisoning deaths in the first six months of 2020.
Children and youth
Almost two thirds of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25.
In 2021 - only 54% of children and youth under 26 compared to 60% of adults 26 and older reported
excellent or very good mental health, a decrease from 77% and 72%, respectively, in 2011.
In 2020, 13.4% of youth aged 12 to 25 reported unmet needs for mental health care, compared to 8.3%
of those older than 25. In 2020, over 35,000 children and youth were hospitalized for mental health
disorders.
Nearly one in four hospitalization of children and youth (aged 5-24) in Canada were for mental health
conditions in 2020, based on CIHI data. Female children 15-17 were two times more likely than males of
the same age group to be hospitalized.
There has been a steady increase in the prescription of mood and anxiety medications for children and
youth, particularly for females, over the past five years in Canada.
The current opioid crisis
While hospitalizations for most other conditions declined during the first 16 months of the pandemic
period (March 2020 to June 2021), hospitalizations for harms caused by substance use rose by 9%,
according to CIHI data.
There was a total of 38,514 apparent opioid toxicity deaths between January 2016 and March 2023 in
Canada, according to a PHAC surveillance report released in September 2023. The report also found
that:
There was a total of 37,697 opioid-related and 16,231 stimulant-related poisoning hospitalizations from
January 2016 to March 2023 in Canada (excluding Quebec)
There have been more than 9,000 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) responses to suspected opioid-
related overdoses so far in 2023 (January – March).
The majority of opioid-related deaths and hospitalizations occurred in British Columbia, Alberta, and
Ontario; although high rates are also observed within other regions.
Rates of accidental stimulant-related hospitalizations in Canada were highest in British Columbia,
Alberta, and Saskatchewan.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
Budget 2023 confirmed the Government of Canada’s commitment to mental health and substance use
care in Canada through $25B in funding to provinces and territories through tailored bilateral
agreements. These bilateral agreements will support progress on four shared priorities, with mental
health and substance use addressed by or included within all four priorities. This investment builds on
previous federal commitments including $5 billion over ten years in Budget 2017 to provinces and
territories for mental health and substance use services.
Additionally, to reflect the Government of Canada’s comprehensive approach to addressing the overdose
crisis, targeted funding of over $1B has been allocated across federal departments and agencies to
address key, interrelated priorities, including $400M through Health Canada’s Substance Use and
Addictions Program
Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy
The Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy is the federal government’s comprehensive response to the
overdose crisis and substance related harms in Canada. The goal of the CDSS is to improve the health
and safety of all Canadians by minimizing substance-related harms for individuals, families, and
communities. The renewed CDSS, announced as part of Budget 2023, is receiving a total of $359.2
million in investment over five years. These funds are in addition to existing CDSS funding.
988 and Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is supporting the launch and implementation of 9-8-8, a new, national three-
digit number for suicide prevention and emotional distress. As of November 30, 2023, the 9-8-8: Suicide
Crisis Helpline will provide crisis support to all people in Canada via phone and text, 24 hours a day and
seven days a week. Budget 2023 announced $158.4 million over 3 years to support the launch and
implementation of 9-8-8. In the meantime, people in Canada continue to have access to Talk Suicide
Canada which provides 24/7 suicide prevention crisis support (led by the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health and partners). The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health was also selected to lead the
coordination of 9-8-8 service delivery.
Building on the existing Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention (2016), the Public Health Agency of
Canada (PHAC) is leading the development of the National Suicide Prevention Action Plan. Given the
complexity of suicide and the multiple partners involved in suicide prevention, a phased approach is
being pursued. Phase I (target release of Winter 2023), will lay the foundation, with the aim of setting
the vision and identifying early areas for action. Phase II will build on engagement efforts with partners
including federal government departments, provinces and territories, Indigenous partners and other key
stakeholders to inform future phases including the co-development of concrete actions as well as
monitoring progress.
Mental Health of Canadians
Integrated Youth Services. An example of a shared priority for federal, provincial and territorial
governments is the development and expansion of integrated youth services (IYS) models. This is part of
the broader priority of building mental health and wellbeing through prevention, promotion and services
for children, youth and families, which was endorsed by FPT Health Ministers at the Health Ministers
Meeting in October 2023. Budget 2023 funding through tailored bilateral agreements and ongoing
Budget 2017 funding for mental health and substance use is supporting the advancement of this priority
and the expansion of IYS.
IYS models of care provide locally relevant, effective, youth-focused, and integrated services for mental
health/substance use within the community. All thirteen provinces and territories have developed or are
developing an IYS network, with a pan-Canadian Indigenous IYS network in progress. As of 2023, there
are 75 active IYS sites in Canada, and another 55 under development. CIHR is leading the IYS Network of
Networks initiative allowing for research and evaluation to inform continuous innovation and learning, as
well as responsivity to emerging challenges.
Complex Needs. Supporting individuals with complex needs (severe and persistent mental illness,
substance use, housing precarity and often other health and social issues) was one of two priorities for
2023-2024 endorsed by FPT Health Ministers at the Health Ministers Meeting (HMM) in Charlottetown,
PEI in October 2023. This follows $5 billion in federal funding over 10 years through the Common
Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities (CSOP) in 2017, which included improving access to
mental health and substance use services for people with complex needs. Actions will be taken over the
next year to synthesize best practices related to integrated, intersectoral service models and the health
workforce for serving these individuals.
Improving Mental Health Literacy. Many funding programs and actions are underway across the Health
Portfolio to support and improve the mental wellness and health literacy of Canadians. As one
component of mental health promotion, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is funding targeted
mental health literacy initiatives. The University of Alberta received a grant for $250,000 to develop an
repository of evidence-based mental health literacy interventions for children and youth. The repository
is expected to be released in February 2024. In addition, PHAC is partnering with the Canadian Centre for
Occupational Health and Safety to develop mental health literacy resources to support workplaces
across Canada, which will be released in March 2024.
In Budget 2022, the Government Canada invested a further $140 million over two years for Wellness
Together Canada (WTC), which provides immediate access to high-quality supports and services ranging
from basic wellness information, self-directed courses and programs, counselling sessions, and
communities of community support.
Perinatal Mental Health. Health Canada is providing $372,000 over 19 months to Women’s College
Hospital to develop a Canadian National Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Perinatal Mental
Illness, with a corresponding Patient and Family Guide. The Canadian National Clinical Practice Guideline
for the Treatment of Perinatal Mental Illness led by Women’s College Hospital will focus on the
identification and treatment of mood, anxiety and related disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum
period. It will follow best practices around treatment guideline development, with a key focus on
Canadian contexts and themes, including those identified during the Ministerial roundtable on perinatal
mental health on March 9, 2022.
Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use (MHSU). In March 2022, following commitments in
Budget 2021, Health Canada partnered with the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to coordinate the
development of standards and related deliverables. Priority areas for standards development were
identified in alignment with the Common Statement of Principles on Shared Health Priorities and
endorsed by FPT governments in 2017. The six priority areas include: 1) Integration of MHSU in Primary
Care; 2) Digital MHSU Apps; 3) IYS; 4) Integrated MHSU Services for Complex Needs; 5) Substance Use
Treatment Centres – Withdrawal Management; and 6) Substance Use Workforce – Prescriber
Competencies for Non-Addictions Providers. Deliverables will be evidence-based and informed by key
stakeholders including people with lived and living experience.
ISSUE SHEET – MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING (MAID)
LEGISLATIVE TIMELINE FOR MAID
March 2021: Former Bill C-7 removed the RFND eligibility criterion, created a 2-track system of
safeguards and temporarily excluded mental illness eligibility until March 2023.
An independent expert review on MAID and mental illness was initiated (Summer 2021) by the federal
Ministers of Health and Justice and a final report tabled in Parliament in May 2022.
Special Joint Parliamentary Committee (AMAD) examined complex MAID issues including MAID where
mental illness is the sole underlying condition, incl. interim report on mental illness, Jun 2022.
Fall 2022: Increasing concerns raised whether the health care system was ready to safely assess MAID
requests where the sole underlying condition is a mental illness.
Divergent opinions on level of readiness; recognized a great deal of progress made to prepare for MAID
requests; some PTs needed more time (political opposition by AB).
Needed time to consider the recommendations of the AMAD final report (February 15, 2023)A
March 2023: Former Bill C-39 delayed the lifting of the temporary exclusion of mental illness for MAID
eligibility for one year, until March 17, 2024.
Prudent approach to allow time for the dissemination and uptake of key resources (Model MAID Practice
Standards; MAID Training Curriculum) and other activities (Indigenous engagement; enhanced data
collection; oversight) to support health system preparedness.
October 18, 2023: Private Members Bill C-314 (CPC Ed Fast) was voted down. The Bill proposed to
permanently eliminate MAID eligibility for people with mental illness as a sole underlying medical
condition.
RECENT PUBLIC POLLING ON MAID AND ON EXPANSION OF MAID FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
Majority of Canadians (64%) support the previous rules governing MAID, first passed in 2016 and also
when the law was updated in 2021 (60%) removing the requirement for a reasonably foreseeable natural
death.
There is more hesitation when it comes to the planned expansion for eligibility MAID for mental illness in
March 2024. Three-in-ten (28%) say they support allowing those whose sole medical condition is mental
illness to seek MAID, while half are opposed (50%). (Sept 2023 Angus Reid)
35% of Canadians surveyed strongly supported, and 45% somewhat supported, with the appropriate
safeguards in place, that an adult with the capacity to provide informed consent should be able to seek
an assessment for MAID, and if eligible, receive MAID, for a severe, treatment-resistant mental disorder
for which they experience intolerable suffering. (June 2023, Ipsos)
When surveyed, 41% of members of the Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) agreed or strongly
agreed when asked whether persons whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental disorder
should be considered for eligibility for MAID, while 39% disagreed or strongly disagreed and 20% were
undecided (October 2020)
In the same survey, when CPA members were asked if it is possible for a mental disorder to be
considered grievous and irremediable: 65% Agree or Strongly Agree; 25% Disagree or Strongly Disagree;
12% Undecided (October 2020)
FEDERAL ANNUAL REPORTS ON MAID IN CANADA
New Data from the Fourth Annual Report
The total number of medically assisted deaths reported in Canada since the introduction of federal MAID
legislation in 2016 is 44,958.
In 2022, there were 13,241 MAID provisions reported in Canada, accounting for 4.1% of all deaths in
Canada (does this include both RFND and non-RFND? Pls clarify) This falls within the range experienced
in other jurisdictions with assisted dying regimes (Belgium, 2.5% in 2022; Netherlands, 5.1% in 2022)
The number of cases of MAID in 2022 represents a growth rate of 31.2% over 2021. All provinces except
Manitoba and the Yukon continued to experience a steady year-over-year growth in 2022.
The average age of individuals at the time MAID was provided in 2022 was 77.0 years which is slightly
higher than the averages of 2019 (75.2), 2020 (75.3) and 2021 (76.3).
Similar to all other years, Cancer (63.0%) remains the most cited underlying medical condition among
MAID provisions in 2022. This is followed by cardiovascular conditions (18.8%), other conditions (14.9%),
respiratory conditions (13.2%) and neurological conditions (12.6%).
In 2022, 3.5% of the total number of MAID provisions (463 individuals), were individuals whose natural
deaths were not reasonably foreseeable (non-RFND). This is an increase from 2.2% in 2021 (223
individuals). Non-RFND MAID provisions account for about 0.1% of all deaths in Canada.
The most cited underlying medical condition for non-RFND MAID cases was neurological (50.0%),
followed by other conditions (37.1%), and multiple comorbidities (23.5%), which is similar to 2021
results.
The average age of non-RFND individuals receiving MAID was 73.1 years, slightly higher than 70.1 in
2021 but lower than the average age of 77.0 for all MAID recipients in 2022.
In 2022, MAID practitioners reported that the majority of MAID recipients (77.6%) had received
palliative care, a level similar to the three previous years.
In 2022, 560 individuals were assessed as ineligible for MAID. The reason for a determination of
ineligibility varies depending on whether an individual’s death was reasonably foreseeable or not
reasonably foreseeable.
The main reason for ineligibility for individuals whose natural death was reasonably foreseeable was that
the individual was not deemed capable of making decisions with respect to their health (41.3%),
consistent with previous years.
For individuals whose natural death was not reasonably foreseeable, the main reasons for a finding of
ineligibility were not having a serious illness, disease, or disability (54.4%), not being in an advanced
state of decline (54.0%) and not having intolerable suffering (45.1%).
KEY CONCERNS RELATED TO EXPANSION
It is anticipated that efforts by MAID critics will become more vocal in the Fall-Winter 2023 to delay, or
permanently remove eligibility for MAID and mental illness.
Some of the concerns expressed either in the media or from stakeholder groups opposed to the
expansion focus on:
Defining grievous and irremediable in the context of a mental illness
Distinguishing between a request for MAID and suicidal ideation
Need for guidelines and standards for consistent practice of MAID
Education and training tools for assessors and psychiatrists
Data collection and evidence gathering to help evaluate MAID implementation
The impact of the expansion on suicide prevention
The impact on health systems and health care (i.e. human resources/access to mental health
supports/wait times)
PROVINCIAL-TERRITORIAL PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES FOR EXPANSION
creating specific teams to support complex case assessments (i.e., clinical consultation/review), a
process that supports the objectives of prospective oversight
developing / refining retrospective oversight mechanisms (i.e., reviewing cases after MAID delivery)
adding resources (i.e., health workforce) to support navigation / assessment or leveraging resources in
other jurisdictions where requests/provisions are low
encouraging training using the newly launched nationally accredited MAID training curriculum to help
clinicians in addressing requests for more complex MAID cases, including where mental illness is the sole
underlying medical condition.
updating MAID practice standards, many referencing the Model MAID Practice Standard
REDACTED
FEDERAL ACTIONS
The Government of Canada has supported valuable work towards preparing for the expansion in March
2024. This work has gone a long way to addressing many but not all of the concerns expressed by those
opposed to MAID expansion.
Release of a Model Practice Standard for MAID (March 2023): provides regulatory bodies and clinicians
with advice on the assessment of complex MAID requests, including persons with a mental disorder as
their sole medical condition. An Advice to the Profession document provides a series of questions and
responses which elaborate upon specific clinical questions raised by the Model Standard including
assessing incurability and differentiating between a request for MAID and suicidal ideation.
6 PTs are in the process of updating practice standards, drawing upon elements from the Model Practice
Standard (BC, AB, NS, MB, ON, YK) – ready prior to March 2024
2 PTs are in early stages of engagement with their regulatory bodies to update practice standards but
have indicated interest in drawing upon the Model Practice Standard (PEI, SK).
NB, NU and NL less advanced in planning or do not have practice standards in place.
NT and QC’s current standards/guidelines already align closely with the Model Standard.
Knowledge Exchange Workshop (June 2023): Health Canada funded a Knowledge Exchange Workshop
held in Montreal bringing together over 40 MAID practitioners and psychiatrists from each jurisdiction to
discuss roles and responsibilities for assessing and managing requests based solely on mental disorder,
and how to support local training related to MAID for mental disorders.
Launch of MAID Curriculum (August-Sept 2023): Launch of a nationally accredited, bilingual Canadian
MAID Curriculum (developed by the Canadian Association of MAID Assessors and Providers-CAMAP)
gives practitioners (those new to MAID practice and those with experience) important information,
guidance and tools to improve their assessment skills.
Six of the seven training modules are now available for registration (free), the full curriculum will be
available by end of this year.
Over 600 physicians, nurse practitioners and psychiatrists across Canada have registered to have access
to the curriculum
31 experienced MAID clinicians have been trained to teach the curriculum. Another 60 are targeted to
be trained by January 2024.
CAMAP is promoting registration for 11 in-person facilitated sessions across the country between
September and November 2023 on 3 modules (Module 3: How to do a MAID Assessment, Module 5:
Providing MAID, and Module 7: MAID and Mental Disorders). Another 10 facilitated sessions are being
planned.
CAMAP is also developing system coordination guides, patient journey maps and clinical assessment
tools for complex cases including where mental illness is involved (by February 2024).
ISSUE SHEET – BLOOD AND PLASMA COLLECTION
ISSUE :
Claims have surfaced that paid plasma collection by private companies is causing blood and blood
product shortages. The Canadian blood system, operated by Héma-Québec in Quebec and Canadian
Blood Services (CBS) in the rest of Canada, has not been privatized and there is no evidence that paid,
commercial plasma collection impacts blood donations in Canada.
CANADIAN BLOOD SYSTEM
Blood and plasma collection in Canada is within provincial and territorial jurisdiction as part of the
healthcare system. CBS and Héma-Québec, the national blood operators, are responsible for managing
Canada and Quebec’s blood systems at arm’s length and on behalf of the provinces and territories.
Only Héma-Québec, in the province of Quebec, and CBS, in the rest of Canada, can collect whole blood
in Canada, and only these organizations can distribute blood and plasma products in Canada.
The Provinces and Territories determine how plasma is collected in their jurisdictions, including the role
of paid, commercial plasma collection. At present, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec have
legislation that prevents the operation of paid, commercial plasma collection – commercial operators
can therefore operate in any other jurisdiction.
The blood operators collect enough blood to meet the needs of Canadians, but collect only some of the
plasma needed to meet demand for plasma-derived products (PDPs). The remainder needed are
purchased by CBS and Héma-Québec on international markets, which have been strained over the past
five years both for pricing and access to supply. Canada, so far, has weathered this situation well and no
shortages have occurred.
Health Canada’s primary role in the blood system is to regulate the safety of blood and plasma collection
and products made from blood and plasma. Any site collecting blood or plasma must be authorized and
licensed by Health Canada.
Health Canada is required by the Blood Regulations to review all submissions it receives, including those
for authorizing and licensing commercial, paid plasma operations.
BLOOD COLLECTION, LOW INVENTORY, AND SHORTAGES
As mentioned, Héma-Québec and CBS are responsible for blood collection and distribution of blood
products in the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada, respectively.
Outside of Quebec, the National Emergency Blood Management Committee, on behalf of provinces,
territories, and CBS, monitors situations such as low inventory levels. This committee will act to
investigate and rectify any low inventory or shortage situation, as per The National Plan for Management
of Shortages of Labile Blood Components (the Plan), first introduced in 2009.
Under the Plan, Green Phase implies that normal blood component inventory levels exist and supply
generally meets demand. Amber Phase implies that the national blood inventory is insufficient to
continue with routine transfusion practices and blood usage will need to be reduced. Red Phase implies
that blood inventory levels are insufficient to ensure patients with non-elective indications will receive
the required transfusions.
Since the creation of CBS there have been no blood shortages. In 2015 a ‘Green Phase Advisory’ was
added to the Plan to help mitigate brief supply disruptions or supply more knowledge regarding hospital
inventories/practices when supplies were tenuous but had not met Amber Phase criteria. Since then,
Green Phase Advisories have been declared twice in 2016, once in 2018, twice in 2020, and once in
2021. The most recent Green Phase Advisory has been in effect since June, 2023, and is related to low
inventories of O and some A blood cells.
PLASMA COLLECTION
Many Canadians rely on plasma and plasma products (PDPs) to treat life-threatening conditions. During
the COVID-19 crisis, global demand, prices, and worldwide shortages increased.
At the end of 2021-22, CBS supplied 15% of the plasma needed to make PDPs used by Canadians while
Héma-Québec attained 30% of domestic plasma supply for Quebec in 2021-22. The remainder of PDPs
needed are purchased on international markets and the large majority of these products come from paid
donors. The need to enhance domestic plasma collection has been a long-standing issue.
Health Canada is committed to safeguarding Canada’s plasma and blood supply systems, ensuring that
all establishments that collect plasma are strictly regulated, and that plasma products sold in Canada are
manufactured in accordance with rigorous safety standards, regardless of where the plasma comes from,
and whether donors were compensated.
PDPs made from plasma donated by paid donors are as safe as those made from plasma donated by
volunteer donors.
Payment for for plasma is solely within the jurisdiction of Provinces and Territories, and is not a federal
matter.
Outside of Quebec, Provinces and Territories have been funding CBS to increase plasma collection, and
requested $20M from the Federal Government in 2020, which was included in Budget 2021 for the
construction of plasma collection sites by CBS. With provincial, territorial and federal funding, CBS is
aiming to construct a total of 11 dedicated plasma collection sites by the end of 2024 to meet 25% of
demand by 2028.
In 2021-22, commercial plasma collectors were operating in New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta. Plasma collected by these companies was sold on international markets, and did not
contribute to Canadian sufficiency for plasma products.
In 2022, CBS entered into a 15 year agreement with industry partner Grifols, a major international
pharmaceutical company specializing in plasma collection and PDP manufacturing. Protections for the
national blood supply system are a vital part of the agreement and include controls to prevent negative
impacts on CBS’ current and future network of blood and plasma donor centres. This agreement will see
Grifols provide 25% sufficiency for PDPs (in addition to the 25% to be collected by CBS), made from
plasma collected in Canada.
Since signing the agreement last year, Grifols has purchased or entered into purchasing agreements with
the only private plasma collectors that were operating in Canada. This, alongside the protections in the
agreement, mean that CBS will not face any competition for the foreseeable future, and plasma
collected in Canada will be used to help Canadians, instead of being shipped out of the country.
Grifols has also received permission from Ontario to operate in Ontario as an agent of CBS (i.e. Grifols
will pay donors for plasma in Ontario, but only because of their agreement with CBS). British Columbia
declined a similar request. Grifols will be able to operate in all other Provinces and Territories where CBS
operates.
ISSUE OF PAID PLASMA COLLECTION IMPACTING BLOOD DONATION
There is no evidence that commercial plasma collection impacts blood collection in Canada.
CBS’s agreement with Grifols, and Grifols’ subsequent purchase of all commercial plasma collectors in
Canada over the past year, means that CBS will not face competition at their blood or plasma collection
sites unless another commercial plasma collector decides to enter the Canadian market.
Strains to the blood supply are most likely due to changes to blood donor behaviour resulting in fewer
donations, as seen after the COVID-19 pandemic by blood operators worldwide, and also due to issues in
collection caused by climate events like floods and wildfires.
In response to these challenges, CBS and Héma-Québec are increasing donation hours, the frequency
and size of mobile events, and marketing and donor recruitment activities.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
Health Canada’s primary role in the blood system is to regulate the safety of blood and plasma collection
and products made from blood and plasma.
The Public Health Agency of Canada’s role in the blood system is blood borne disease surveillance.
Through Health Canada, the Government of Canada provides CBS with five million dollars in annual,
ongoing funding for research and development activities. Some of this funding is being used for research
to better understand donor behaviours so as to improve donation rates and accessibility.
The Government of Canada is also providing CBS with 20 million dollars over 2022 to 2024 to construct
plasma collection centres to meet the growing demand for domestic supply. Provinces and Territories are
responsible for all operational costs of these sites, and have other investments in this area.
CBS is receiving $510 thousand dollars from Health Canada to create a National Plasma Shortages
Management Plan, similar to that already in place for blood and blood products, to ensure any future
issues can be mitigated or addressed appropriately if it is ever an issue. Provinces and Territories are
providing an equal investment for this work.
HESA SUPPS C BACKGROUNDER – HEALTH PRODUCT SHORTAGES
DRUG AND MEDICAL DEVICE SHORTAGES
Drug and medical device shortages are a global issue and can arise for many reasons, including
manufacturing disruptions, difficulty in obtaining raw ingredients or packaging materials, major weather
events affecting manufacturing sites and market demand.
68% of Canadian drugs are imported from outside of Canada and 83% of activities related to drug
production (e.g., manufacturing, packaging, labeling) are performed outside of Canada.
Most medical devices on the Canadian market are also imported.
Canada holds only 2% of the global market share for drug sales and 1.8% of the global market share for
medical devices.
As of October 23, 2023, there are 25 drug shortages considered to be national and critical. Health
Canada is working closely with companies and stakeholders to resolve them.
As of October 23, 2023, there are 7 categories of devices that are being closely monitored and Health
Canada is working with stakeholders to resolve these shortages.
KEY SHORTAGES OF CONCERN
Example of high-profile shortages being case managed by Health Canada include:
Amoxicillin oral suspension: The oral suspension format has been in critical, national shortage since
November 2022. Though other formats remain available, Health Canada is closely monitoring demand
levels and has approved the exceptional importation of foreign-authorized product and continues to
mobilize stakeholders.
Ozempic (1 mg pre-filled pen): Intermittent shortages are expected until April 2024 due to supply
constraints and increased global demand. Other formats remain available, but not in adequate quantities
to make up for shortages of the 1mg pen. Together with partners, Health Canada continues to closely
monitor the supply situation and has prepared instructions for health care practitioners on alternatives.
Nitroglycerin: Nitroglycerin pump spray has been in shortage since early 2023 due to supply disruptions
at a manufacturer with a large market share. Health Canada has worked with stakeholders to provide
guidance to healthcare practitioners and to extend expiry dates for existing product. Health Canada is
also evaluating the possibility of accessing foreign supply and working with other Canadian
manufacturers to increase supply.
Analgesics, cough and cold medicines: Product is readily available at community and hospital
pharmacies, and manufacturer and distributor inventories have been replenished. Increased production
and monitoring for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and COVID-19 are being used to protect against
shortages in 2023-2024 flu season.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
In 2021, regulations came into force that provide new tools to help prevent and alleviate health product
shortages and to safeguard the supply. These allow the Minister to:
Permit the exceptional importation of drugs and medical devices to address a shortage or an anticipated
shortage.
Require manufacturers and importers of specified medical devices to report shortages and
discontinuances that could lead to a shortage.
Request that drug establishment licence holders and medical device manufacturers, importers, and
distributors provide information needed to assess, prevent, or alleviate a shortage.
In November 2022, the Department established an internal Drug Shortages Task Force to:
Bolster the Department’s capacity to manage health product shortages;
Lead the Government’s medium- to longer-term policy response on health product shortages, building
on the work done within the Department and by partners over the past decade
As part of Health Canada’s work to develop medium- to longer-term options on health product
shortages, the department has actively engagement with provincial and territorial governments, industry
stakeholders, academia, healthcare system partners, Indigenous communities and groups, and the
public.
Health Canada health a public consultation from June 5 to August 31, 2023, receiving 160 written
submissions.
The What We Heard report is targeting publication in fall 2023.
This consultation will support the development of a robust plan moving forward.
ISSUE SHEET – COVID-19/INFLUENZA/RSV OUTLOOK
COVID-19 NUMBERS AND TRENDS
In the latest reporting week (ending October 14), most COVID-19 indicators have continued to increase,
but most severity indicators remain at low to moderate levels. National test percent positivity has
increased since early July and was 17.5% in the latest reporting week, however some provinces and
territories (PTs) may be showing early signs of decreases.
Wastewater signals were increasing in most cities.
Hospitalizations have been increasing over the past 3 months.
The weekly rates of COVID-19 cases hospitalized and admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) remained
highest among the oldest age groups.
Deaths have gradually increased since mid-July but remain low.
Nationally, recombinant XBB sub-lineages continue to be dominant, representing 97% of sequences in
the past month.
EG. 5 is the only lineage group demonstrating consistent growth in Canada.
Based on data from 6 of the 13 Canadian provinces and territories reporting case and death updates,
during the week of October 12 to October 18, 2023:
the total number of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients decreased from 3,797 to 3,786 beds.
the number of non-ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients decreased from 3,651 to 3,631 beds.
the number of ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients increased from 146 to 157 beds.
the number of COVID-19 patients who were mechanically vented increased from 68 to 69.
Due to changes in COVID-19 testing policies in many jurisdictions since December 2021, case counts are
underestimated.
INFLUENZA NUMBERS AND TRENDS
Influenza is circulating at low and within expected levels. To date for this influenza season (August 27,
2023 to October 14, 2023):
768 influenza detections were reported.
Of these detections, 92% (705) were influenza A and among subtyped influenza A detections (476),
influenza A(H1N1) accounted for 79% of detections; this is expected based on international influenza
trends. Subtypes can impact overall influenza activity levels.
541 laboratory-confirmed influenza detections with age information were reported, of which 228 (42%)
were in individuals aged 65+ years old
There were 41 influenza-associated hospitalizations reported by participating provinces and territories.
Adults aged 65 years of age and older accounted for 56% of reported hospitalizations.
Less than five ICU admissions have been reported.
Less than five influenza-associated deaths have been reported.
RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS (RSV) NUMBERS AND TRENDS
Currently, RSV is circulating at low and within expected levels.
During the week of October 8 to 14, 20,306 laboratory tests were conducted, the test percent positivity
for RSV was 1.79%.
IMPACT ON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
Fall 2022 marked the first combined respiratory virus season in which Canada experienced an early and
intense influenza season during a time of unusually high detections of RSV, putting increased strain on
already stressed healthcare systems.
As expected, COVID-19 is co-circulating with influenza and RSV. It is difficult to predict the levels at which
these viruses may circulate in a given respiratory virus season and ongoing close monitoring will be
critical.
FEDERAL ACTIONS / FUNDING
The Government will be taking all lessons learned into account to be prepared for potential future
pandemics. These efforts will build on significant investments made in response to COVID-19.
In 2022, Canada announced the creation of a Centre for Research on Pandemic Preparedness and Health
Emergencies at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Canada also announced that Moderna would
build a state-of-the-art mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Quebec, to strengthen the domestic
biomanufacturing sector and pandemic preparedness.
In 2021, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) established the Centre for Integrated Risk
Assessment to bolster the Agency’s public health risk assessment capacity to anticipate, detect, and
assess potential public health risks to Canadians.
Canada continues to comprehensively monitor COVID-19 activity while continuing to integrate the
surveillance approach across respiratory viruses.
Canada’s National Emergency Strategic Stockpile is well stocked and we continue to coordinate with PTs
to ensure that medical assets such as personal protective equipment and biomedical equipment are
available to respond to public health emergencies and disasters.
PHAC will continue to work with FPT partners to improve collective governance and work on the
development of shared priorities (e.g. modernizing the health system with data and digital tools)
COVID-19
On September 12, 2023, Health Canada authorized the updated COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) for use in
individuals 6 months of age and older. The updated Pfizer vaccine was authorized on September 28,
2023. Doses of both vaccines are being distributed to PTs.
For fall 2023, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends a dose of the
XBB.1.5-containing formulation of COVID-19 vaccine for people in the authorized age groups if it has
been at least 6 months from the previous COVID-19 vaccine dose or known SARS-CoV-2 infection.
NACI is awaiting further information on the COVID-19 vaccine products that will be available this fall and
will provide additional advice and clarification as needed.
For the fall/winter season, Canada has a sufficient supply of therapeutics as well as COVID-19 vaccines
for every individual who would like one.
INFLUENZA
NACI recommends that everyone 6 months of age and older without contraindications receive an annual
influenza vaccine.
RSV
Health Canada authorized nirsevimab (a monoclonal antibody for infants) on April 19, 2023, and
authorized Arexvy (a vaccine for older adults) on August 4, 2023. Authorization of a vaccine for use in
pregnant people (to protect infants) and older adults is anticipated later this year.
The Government of Canada is supporting PT access to Arexvy, the first and currently only RSV vaccine
authorized for use in Canada in adults 60 years of age and older, through Public Services and
Procurement Canada’s (PSPC) Bulk Procurement Program.
ISSUE SHEET – POST PANDEMIC INQUIRY FOR HESA APPEARANCE
KEY MESSAGES
COVID-19 demanded a robust public health response to tackle the evolving nature of the pandemic.
While Canada was successful on many fronts, the pandemic revealed gaps and inequalities, necessitating
a revisit of Canada’s emergency preparedness and management posture.
To date, there have been more than 100 reviews and assessments examining Canada’s performance.
Findings from numerous reviews, including recommendations from the four reports of the Office of the
Auditor General of Canada, and 18 internal audits and evaluations, informed our real-time adaptive
response during the pandemic, leading to innovative approaches (e.g., wastewater surveillance), and a
recalibration of our preparedness and response posture as new information became available.
We are continuing our work to improve in response to the lessons identified over the course of the
pandemic. Key areas include addressing health inequalities, data collecting and sharing of research,
jurisdictional coordination, biomanufacturing capabilities, and vaccine deployment.
PHAC is also continuing to stock-take and monitor lessons and best practices, and to learn from others,
including our provincial and territorial counterparts and other G7 nations to draw insights that inform a
made-in Canada approach.
The Government of Canada remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health and safety of
Canadians by working to support public health transformation, facilitating building adaptive health
human resources, and strengthening relationships with key communities and other stakeholders.
The Government will be taking all lessons learned into account to be prepared for potential future
pandemics. These efforts will build on significant investments made in response to COVID-19.
ACTIONS TAKEN TO DATE
In 2022, Canada announced the creation of a Centre for Research on Pandemic Preparedness and Health
Emergencies at the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Canada has announced that Moderna will build a state-of-the-art mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in
Quebec, to strengthen the domestic biomanufacturing sector and pandemic preparedness.
National Research Council support for a domestic biological manufacturing facility being built.
In 2021, PHAC established the Centre for Integrated Risk Assessment to bolster the Agency’s public
health risk assessment capacity to anticipate, detect, and assess potential public health risks to
Canadians.
The Health Portfolio will continue to work with FPT partners to improve collective governance via
comprehensive management plans, renewal of the Canadian Pandemic and Influenza Plan, the Vaccine
Connect platform, and work on the development of shared priorities (e.g. modernizing the health system
with data and digital tools).
Maintenance of pandemic and influenza vaccine prep centres, and contracts in place for domestic
personal protective equipment (PPE) manufacturing.
Exercising and scenario planning for future pandemic response.
Inventory and stockpile management capabilities strengthened.
BACKGROUND
Mandate Letter Commitments from December 2021
The Minister of Health Mandate Letter Commitment from December 16, 2021 states the following:
““Governments must draw on lessons learned from the pandemic to further adapt and develop more
agile and effective ways to serve Canadians. To this end, I expect all Ministers to evaluate ways we can
update our practices to ensure our Government continues to meet the challenges of today and
tomorrow.”
Indirectly related is the following Mandate Letter Commitment, from the same Letter: “Work with the
Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to continue demonstrating leadership in public health by
strengthening surveillance and capacity to detect and act on public health threats, strengthening the
security of medical supply chains, working with colleagues to advance the Biomanufacturing and Life
Sciences Strategy, and investing in the study of the long-term health impacts of COVID-19, including the
effects of long COVID on different groups, notably vulnerable populations and children.”
Both commitments are focused on learning from the past, evaluating and integrating promising public
health practices and demonstrating leadership in public health, but do not explicitly call for an inquiry.
Public Calls for Inquiry
On July 24, 2023, The British Medical Journal (BMJ), a globally leading peer-reviewed journal, published a
series of papers focused on accountability in Canada’s COVID-19 response. Similar comments and
criticism of the Canadian response have been issued previously by various stakeholders.
The launch of the BMJ series on pandemic lessons learned have been spotlighted by numerous national
news outlets, including:
The CBC: Top medical experts call for national inquiry into Canada's COVID-19 'failures'
Global News: Call inquiry into Canada’s COVID-19 response, medical journal urges
The Globe and Mail: Should Canada conduct a national COVID response inquiry? The BMJ thinks so
In October 2022, a statement provided by the office of the previous Health Minister "committed to a
review of the response to COVID-19 in order to take stock of lessons learned and to better inform
preparations and responses to future health emergencies", was published by the CBC.
