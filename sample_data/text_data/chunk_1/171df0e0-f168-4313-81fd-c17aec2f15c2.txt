The purpose of this Cyclical Enforcement (CE) project was to verify industry’s compliance of feeding bottle nipples to the chemical requirements of the Infant Feeding Bottle Nipples Regulations. For this project, compliance of select feeding bottle nipples with the Infant Feeding Bottle Nipples Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments and sampled relevant products. Compliance to the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating this CE project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of feeding bottle nipple companies in Canada. Nipple products that were not silicone based were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2019-2020 fiscal year, chemical testing of 4 different products was carried out. The chemical testing resulted in no compliance issues detected, and therefore, no corrective actions were required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action. Summary of the samples assessed and corrective actions taken during this project Brand Product Name Source of Sample Determination Corrective Action EcoViking EcoViking Natural Rubber Nipple; Round nipple 0-3 months WestCare Health Supplies Ltd.

No compliance issues detected None Nuk First Essentials Replacement Nipples Latex Newell Brands No compliance issues detected None Disclaimer: A systematic bias is applied during inspection and sampling. Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
