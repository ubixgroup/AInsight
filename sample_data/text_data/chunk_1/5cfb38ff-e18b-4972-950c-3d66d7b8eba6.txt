UN #: Not available Pictogram(s): Figure 1. Figure 1 - Text description The symbol within the pictogram is an exclamation mark. This symbol indicates that hazardous products with this pictogram can cause certain health effects for example: skin irritation eye irritation skin sensitization WHMIS classification Health hazards: Acute Toxicity (Oral) – Category 4 Eye Irritation – Category 2A Physical hazards: EDTA tetrasodium salt does not meet the criteria for classification. Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Category 4 Median lethal dose (LD50) (rat): 1,658 mg/kg. In a study conducted similarly to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 401, the LD50 was 1,658 mg/kg (based on study summary Footnote 1). The study was conducted on 5 Wistar rats per sex per dose by oral gavage. The doses used were 1,210, 1,780, 2,610 and 3,830 mg/kg by weight. Observations were made daily for a period of 14 days. The LD50 of 1,658 mg/kg falls within the HPR range outlined for Acute Toxicity (Oral) Category 4, > 300 mg/kg to ≤ to 2,000 mg/kg [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. The available data meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral) – Category 4 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Acute Toxicity (Dermal): No data available Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable EDTA tetrasodium salt is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): No data available Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Does not meet criteria No human data are available. Multiple studies are available on skin irritation reporting EDTA tetrasodium salt to be not irritating Footnote 2. In a study conducted according to OECD TG 404, 0.5 g of an 80% aqueous preparation of EDTA tetrasodium salt was applied under an occlusive patch to the skin of 3 rabbits for 4 hours Footnote 2. No edema was noted. An average score (24-48-72 hours) for erythema was reported to be 0.43/4. Results of this study do not meet classification criteria for Skin Irritation. In another study, application of 0.5 g of a 40% aqueous solution of EDTA tetrasodium salt to the skin of 3 rabbits for 4 hours under occlusive conditions also did not elicit any skin reactions Footnote 2. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Corrosion / Irritation. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Category 2A No human data are available. In an eye irritation study performed similarly to OECD TG 405, the instillation of 0.1 mL of a 40% aqueous solution of EDTA tetrasodium salt to the eyes of 3 rabbits resulted in average scores (24-48-72 hours) of 1/2 for iritis, 2.56/3 for conjunctival redness and 2.33/4 for chemosis Footnote 2. These results meet the classification criteria for Eye Irritation – Category 2 [HPR 8.3.2(3)]. Since no observations were made after 72 hours, reversibility could not be determined for sub-classification. There are other studies available that were performed before relevant OECD TG were established and used 50 mg (standard amount is 100 mg) of the test substance in 2 rabbits and reported an average corneal score (24-72 hours) of ≥1 in 2/2 rabbits (based on study summary Footnote 1). The effects were not fully reversible within 8 days. The available data meet the classification criteria for Eye Irritation – Category 2A [HPR 8.3.2(3)]. Respiratory Sensitization: Does not meet criteria Nasal provocation tests were conducted on 28 workers with occupational asthma and/or rhinitis Footnote 3. These workers were previously exposed to the disodium (CAS # 139-33-3) and/or the tetrasodium salt of EDTA. They were either exposed to the disodium salt alone or to both salts, in detergents or disinfectants and, in one case, in an air freshener. At concentrations of 1, 2 and 4% of EDTA tetrasodium salt in aqueous solution, 6, 3 and 1 workers were tested. All 10 workers tested positive for sensitization Footnote 3. Due to the absence of supportive evidence of sensitization from exposure to EDTA and its salts, these data do not meet classification criteria. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Respiratory Sensitization. Skin Sensitization: Does not meet criteria A 78-year-old woman with recurrent leg ulcers had mild stasis dermatitis Footnote 2Footnote 4. After applying a paste containing EDTA tetrasodium salt, a weeping dermatitis spread to her legs, arms and face. She yielded a positive response on 2 occasions in a patch test to a 1% aqueous solution of EDTA tetrasodium salt and petrolatum. Due to the widespread use of EDTA and its salts and limited reports of skin sensitization in the literature (only 1 potential case found for EDTA tetrasodium salt), the prevalence of cases is insufficient to meet classification criteria. No animal data are available on EDTA tetrasodium salt. Negative results were obtained for a read-across chemical (EDTA disodium salt, CAS # 139-33-3) in a guinea pig maximization test (based on study summary Footnote 1). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: No data available No in vivo data are available for EDTA tetrasodium salt. A read-across chemical, disodium EDTA, CAS # 139-33-3, tested negative for mutagenicity in a micronucleus test and in a dominant lethal assay when administered orally in mice (based on study summary Footnote 2). No in vitro data are available for EDTA tetrasodium salt. Studies for read-across chemicals disodium EDTA, CAS # 139-33-3 and trisodium EDTA, CAS # 150-38-9, were negative in bacterial and mammalian cell gene mutation assays performed with and without S9 activation (based on study summary Footnote 1). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria EDTA tetrasodium salt has not been reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Negative results were obtained with a read-across chemical, trisodium EDTA (CAS # 150-38-9) Footnote 5. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria In a well-conducted developmental toxicity study, pregnant rats were orally exposed to an equimolar dose of EDTA tetrasodium salt based on 1,000 mg/kg of EDTA (actual dose of 1,374 mg/kg of EDTA tetrasodium salt) by gastric intubation from gestational days 7-14 Footnote 6. There was no effect on litter size or sex ratio. The mortality index (post-implantation loss) and developmental abnormalities were comparable among pups of EDTA tetrasodium salt-treated dams and the control dams. No substance-related statistically significant increase in malformations was observed in the treated animals. Maternal toxicity was evident with diarrhea in 90% of the dams and reduced weight gain during mid gestation. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: An OECD TG 401 study was conducted in rats (10 per sex per dose) gavaged with 1210, 1780, 2000 or 2610 mg/kg EDTA tetrasodium salt. The LD50 was 1780 mg/kg in females. Clinical signs of toxicity at 1780 mg/kg and higher included dyspnea, apathy, ataxia, shaggy fur and poor general state as well as redness and/or bloody ulceration of the glandular part of the stomach, redness of the mucous membrane and general hyperemia (based on study summary Footnote 1). In another OECD TG 401 study conducted in rats (5 per sex per dose) gavaged with 1210, 1780, 2610 or 3830 mg/kg EDTA tetrasodium salt, the LD50 was reported as 1658 mg/kg with clinical signs of dyspnea, apathy, shaggy fur and poor general state as well as stomach pathology of atonic, redness of the mucous membrane and general hyperemia (based on study summary Footnote 1). The effects described in the study summaries occur at or above the LD50 and therefore could be due to the onset of death. These effects do not meet the criteria of this hazard class. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available Inhalation Route of Exposure: No data available The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: No data are available for EDTA, tetrasodium salt. Negative results were obtained for read-across chemicals such as the disodium salt of EDTA, CAS # 139-33-3 Footnote 7 and the tri sodium salt of EDTA, CAS # 150-38-9 Footnote 5, in chronic and sub-chronic studies. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available Inhalation Route of Exposure: No data are available for EDTA, tetrasodium salt. Negative results were obtained in 2 studies, a 28-day and a 90-day study, on a structurally similar substance, Trilon BD (EDTA disodium salt, CAS # 139-33-3) (based on study summary Footnote 1). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure.
