The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of floor coverings with the requirements of the Textile Floor Coverings Regulations (Regulations). For this project, compliance of select floor coverings with the Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments and sampled relevant products. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating inspections, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of floor coverings companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, flammability testing of 14 different products was carried out, where 13 of the 14 samples were imported products. The testing resulted in 1 recall to address non-compliance. There were 13 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
