This collaboration is formalized through memoranda of understanding and a published Regulatory Partnership Statement: Regulatory Partnership Statement between Health Canada and the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration Variances A "variance" refers to a difference between the Hazardous Products Regulations (HPR) and the U.S. Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) that could result in different classification, labelling, safety data sheet (SDS) or other information requirements for a hazardous product in Canada compared to the U.S. Variances can arise due to the need to preserve the current level of protection for workers or as a result of differences between the respective legislative frameworks in the 2 countries. Health Canada and the U.S. OSHA continue to work collaboratively to keep the variances to a minimum. Generally, it remains possible to meet both Canadian and U.S. requirements using a single label and SDS for each hazardous product. Summary of variances between the HPR and HCS RCC Working Group for Workplace Chemicals This regulatory partnership is implemented and managed by senior officials in both Health Canada and U.S. OSHA, and operationalized by the Working Group for Workplace Chemicals, established in 2011. The Working Group for Workplace Chemicals is comprised of technical experts and senior managers from both Health Canada and U.S. OSHA. It meets regularly to discuss progress made in implementing work plans, common challenges or priorities, new initiatives, and the development of new annual work plans.
