The purpose of this Cyclical Enforcement (CE) project was to verify industry’s compliance of children’s sleepwear with specific requirements of the Children’s Sleepwear Regulations and the associated Children’s sleepwear: Flammability requirement guidelines. For this project, compliance of select children’s sleepwear products with the Children’s Sleepwear Regulations and guidelines was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments, and sampled and inspected relevant products. Compliance with the specific requirements listed under the Regulations and guidelines was verified either by Health Canada Inspectors or through flammability testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating this CE project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of children’s sleepwear companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2018-2019 fiscal year, inspections of 92 products were carried out. Of these, 7 samples were sent to the Product Safety Laboratory for flammability testing. The inspections and testing resulted in 16 voluntary recalls, 3 stop sales, 3 stop distributions, and 8 commitments to address non-compliance. There were 62 instances where no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to enforcement actions.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
