These guidelines have been developed by the appropriate ICH Expert Working Groups and have been subject to consultation by the regulatory parties, in accordance with the ICH Process. The ICH Assembly has endorsed the final draft and recommended its implementation by the membership of ICH. In implementing these ICH guidelines, Health Canada endorses the principles and practices described therein. Please note that the ICH website is only available in English. If you would like to request a copy of the French version of the document, please contact the HPFB ICH inbox. It is recognized that the scope and subject matter of current Health Canada guidance documents may not be entirely consistent with those of the ICH guidelines that are being introduced as part of our commitment to international harmonisation and the ICH Process. In such circumstances, Health Canada-implemented ICH guidelines take precedence. Health Canada is committed to eliminating such discrepancies and will publish explanatory notices for stakeholders, where applicable. This will result in the amendment or, depending on the extent of revisions required, withdrawal of some Health Canada guidance documents. Should you have any questions or comments regarding the contents of the ICH guidelines, please contact: Health Canada - ICH Coordinator E-mail: ich@hc-sc.gc.ca Recently finalised ICH guidelines This table lists ICH guidelines that have recently been finalised at ICH and are either pending implementation or have been implemented by Health Canada in the last 12 months Document Type of Notice File Number Additional Notes E19: A Selective Approach to Safety Data Collection in Specific Late Stage Pre-approval or Post-approval Clinical Trials Step 4 -
