Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Does not meet criteria Median lethal dose (LD50): 9,200 mg/kg (rat) Footnote 1. In an acute oral toxicity study, 4,4'-MDI in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was administered by gavage to fasted rats (6 per dose; sex not specified) at doses of 2,000, 4,000, 8,000 or 16,000 mg/kg. The animals were then observed for 14 days. Signs of toxicity were noted at doses of 4,000 mg/kg and higher and included arching, hyporeflexia, lethargy and hypothermy Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral). Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50: >2,000 mg/kg (rabbit)Footnote 1. There were no deaths or signs of intoxication after the occlusive administration of 2,000 mg/kg 4,4'-MDI to the shaved skin of 3 rabbits (sex not specified). After 24 hours, the occlusive wrap was removed and the excess material wiped off Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable 4,4'-MDI is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): Does not meet criteria No mortality occurred at the saturated vapour concentration of 4,4'-MDI; 5 of 6 rats showed respiratory distress in the form of rales which disappeared by 12 hours post exposure. All rats were alive and healthy at the end of the observation period of 14 days. No microscopic changes were observed at necropsy Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation-Vapours). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): Category 2 Median lethal concentration (LC50): 0.368 mg/L (male rat, 4 hours) Footnote 2. In an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 403 study, rats (5 per sex per group) were exposed to a liquid aerosol of 4,4'-MDI at a concentration of 300.0, 354.2, 399.2, 500.0 or 553.8 mg/m3. Mortality occurred in a concentration-dependent manner at 354.2 mg/m3 and above. Male rats appeared to be more susceptible than female rats. The LC50 was 0.368 mg/L (male rats) Footnote 2. The available data for mists of 4,4'-MDI meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation) – Category 2 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Does not meet criteria In an OECD TG 404 study, 4,4'-MDI tested negative for skin irritation Footnote 2. The mean score (24, 48, 72 hours) was 0.61/4 for edema. The scoring for erythema could not be obtained due to colouration of the skin with the test substance. In a Draize study, 0.5 mL of 4,4'-MDI was applied to intact and abraded skin of 6 rabbits under semi-occlusive conditions for 24 hours. The combined primary irritation score was 0.47. Skin exposure did not result in skin irritation Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Corrosion / Irritation. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Category 2 In a well-conducted study equivalent in design to OECD TG 405, application of 100 mg of 4,4'-MDI to 6 rabbit eyes resulted in eye irritation Footnote 1. The mean scores (24, 48 and 72 hours) were 2.5/3 for conjunctival redness, 2.4/4 for chemosis, and 1/2 for iritis, meeting the classification criteria for Category 2. Since no observations were made after 72 hours, reversibility could not be determined for sub-categorization. The available data meet the classification criteria for Eye Irritation – Category 2 [HPR 8.3.2(3)]. Respiratory Sensitization: Category 1 Many human case studies are available demonstrating respiratory sensitization consistent with a high degree of proportionality amongst multiple responders Footnote 3Footnote 4Footnote 5Footnote 6Footnote 7Footnote 8. Specifically, an inhalation challenge test found that 21/59 of workers exposed to 4,4'-MDI experienced positive asthmatic and acute allergic alveolitis reactions Footnote 4. In another inhalation challenge test, 8 human subjects who were also workers at a plant using 4,4'-MDI were exposed to 4,4'-MDI resin for 4 - 120 minutes daily Footnote 7. A significant drop in the forced expiratory volume in the first second and in the forced vital capacity was seen in all 8 participants. Other studies in humans have demonstrated that 4,4'-MDI exposure can cause respiratory allergies in those who have been occupationally exposed to 4,4'-MDI Footnote 6. The study of the association between these allergic responses and Immunoglobulin E (IgE) production has seen mixed results. In some studies, there are people who experience an allergic response but see no changes in IgE levels. In others exposed to 4,4'-MDI but who do not experience any allergy symptoms, IgE production has been detected Footnote 6. Based on human data, 4,4'-MDI meets the classification criteria for Category 1 of HPR 8.4.1(1). Insufficient study details are available to sub-classify. Animals: 4,4'-MDI failed to produce airway resistance in guinea pigs following challenge at lower concentrations; only a slight tracheobronchitis was observed Footnote 9. The available data meet the classification criteria for Respiratory Sensitizer – Category 1 [HPR 8.4.1(1)]. Skin Sensitization: Category 1A There are several case reports of 4,4'-MDI-mediated contact dermatitis in humans Footnote 10Footnote 11Footnote 12. Positive results were also obtained in mouse local lymph node assays (LLNA), with stimulation indices (SI) of 16.88 and 27.04 reported when exposed to 1% 4,4'-MDI Footnote 13Footnote 14. The estimated concentration needed to produce an SI of 3 (EC3) was < 2% in these studies, meeting classification criteria for Category 1A. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitizer – Category 1A [HPR 8.4.1(4)]. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In vivo: Negative results were obtained in mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus tests, in accordance with OECD TG 474, in rats Footnote 2 and in mice Footnote 15 when exposed to 4,4'-MDI aerosols. In vitro: Negative results were obtained in bacterial cells, Salmonella (S.) typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA97, in an Ames assay, with and without metabolic activation when an appropriate vehicle (ethyleneglycol dimethylether, EGDE) was used Footnote 2. 4,4'-MDI was found to be mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA100 and TA98 with metabolic activation when DMSO was used as a solvent Footnote 16Footnote 17, although it has been demonstrated that 4,4'-MDI is unstable in DMSO Footnote 18. Contrary to this, in another Ames study, 4,4'-MDI tested negative in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and TA97, in the presence and absence of metabolic activation, when DMSO was used as a solvent Footnote 19. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 4,4'-MDI as Group 3 – not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans Footnote 20. 4,4'-MDI has not been evaluated for carcinogenicity by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) nor the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). A 2-year chronic repeat-dose toxicity and carcinogenicity study by the inhalation route of exposure was conducted on 4,4'-MDI (study summary in Footnote 21). Groups of 80 female Wistar rats were exposed to 4,4'-MDI aerosols, whole-body, at 0.23, 0.70 or 2.05 mg/m3 for 17 hours per day, 5 days per week, for up to 24 months. A single treatment-related bronchio-alveolar adenoma was observed in one high-dose animal. However, the difference in incidence of adenomas between the high-dose and control group was not statistically significant (study summary in Footnote 21). Although a carcinogenicity study is also available on the polymeric form of 4,4'-MDI (pMDI), where a statistically significant increase in lung adenomas was observed in males of the high-dose group (study summary in Footnote 21), this study is not considered for classification purposes. As adequate data of the type referred to in subparagraph 2.1(a)(ii) of the HPR is available on 4,4'-MDI to evaluate its carcinogenicity, data on a similar substance of the types referred to in subparagraphs 2.1(b)(i) to (iv) of the HPR are not considered. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria 4,4'-MDI tested negative in a reproductive toxicity study combined with a chronic repeat-dose toxicity study Footnote 2. Female rats (20 per concentration) were exposed to 0.23, 0.70 or 2.05 mg/m³ of respirable aerosols of 4,4'-MDI for 17 hours per day, 5 days per week for up to 24 months. No treatment related findings were reported on assessed reproductive organs, which included adrenals, ovaries, uterus, vagina and mammary gland. In an embryo-toxicity study, rats (10 per sex per concentration) were exposed by whole-body inhalation to 1, 3 or 9 mg/m3 4,4'-MDI for 6 hours per day from days 6-15 post-conception Footnote 22. A significant reduction in food consumption was observed in the mid- and high-concentration groups. Treatment did not influence any reproductive or fetal parameters (number of corpora lutea, implantation sites, pre- and post-implantation loss, fetal and placental weights, gross and visceral anomalies, and degree of ossification). A slight but significant increase in litters with fetuses displaying a skeletal anomaly (asymmetric sternebra(e)) was reported; however, this was only observed after exposure to the highest concentration (9 mg/m3). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: Central nervous system (CNS) effects, including arching, hyporeflexia, lethargy and hypothermy, were observed at high exposure concentrations of 4,4'-MDI in rats (4,000 - 16,000 mg/kg) in a single-dose acute toxicity study Footnote 1. These doses exceed the concentration value ranges for classification. Dermal Route of Exposure: No deaths or signs of intoxication were reported in rats in a well-conducted single-dose acute toxicity study up to a dose level of 4,4'-MDI of 2,000 mg/kg Footnote 1. Inhalation Route of Exposure: In an OECD TG 403 study, rats were exposed to 4,4'-MDI aerosols at 300.0, 354.2, 399.2, 500.0 or 553.8 mg/m3 for 4 hours Footnote 2. The exposure caused irritation in the respiratory tract. Mortality was concentration dependent, beginning at 354.2 mg/m3, and was associated with acute lung edema. The authors of the study concluded that the lower respiratory tract effects are dependent on a highly respirable aerosol not usually encountered in the workplace. Autopsies revealed no abnormal findings in animals sacrificed at the end of the observation period. As a result, these data do not meet the criteria for classification. In another study, 6 rats were exposed to the saturated vapor concentration of 4,4'-MDI for 4 hours Footnote 1. All animals survived until the end of the observation period of 14 days. Of the 6 animals exposed, 5 showed respiratory distress evidenced by rales, which disappeared by hour 12 and all the rats were alive and healthy at day 14. Autopsy showed no adverse effects in any of the tissues of the surviving rats. As a result, these data do not meet the criteria for classification. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Category 2 Oral Route of Exposure: No data available Dermal Route of Exposure: In a repeat-dose skin exposure study, 0.5 g of 4,4'-MDI was applied daily to the skin of 6 rabbits for 20 days Footnote 1. Only edema and erythema were observed, with no mention of systemic toxicity. Inhalation Route of Exposure: In a chronic inhalation toxicity study for 4,4'-MDI, female rats were exposed to 0.23, 0.70 or 2.05 mg/m3 4,4'-MDI aerosols for 18 hours per day, 5 days per week for 24 months Footnote 23. A control group was exposed to the clean air. The study reported a dose-dependent impairment of lung function, increased lung weights, and an intermediately retarded lung clearance only in the high-dose group, as well as slight-to-moderate dose-dependent interstitial fibrosis and alveolar bronchiolization observed also only in the high-dose group. The available data meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure – Category 2. Aspiration Hazard: No data available No human data are available for 4,4'-MDI.
