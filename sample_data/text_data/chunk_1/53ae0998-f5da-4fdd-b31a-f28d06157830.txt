Notes: A Health Canada safety review was carried out as a follow-up assessment on the potential risk of retinal detachment with the use of oral fluoroquinolones. Health Canada's previous safety review examined the risk of retinal detachment with oral fluoroquinolones and had concluded that limited evidence was available to support a link at that time. Since Health Canada's initial review, many other studies have been conducted regarding the potential link between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment triggering this follow-up safety review.

Health Canada's follow-up safety review on the link between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment was carried out to assess new evidence since the completion of Heath Canada's initial review on this issue in 2013. Health Canada's follow-up safety review concluded that a potential link between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment could not be ruled out at this time. Given that retinal detachment is a medical emergency, the recommendations of the Health Canada review were that the current labeling for oral fluoroquinolones be revised to highlight the urgency to consult a health care professional if patients experienced vision problems during or following oral fluoroquinolone's administration. Overview A Health Canada safety review was carried out as a follow-up assessment on the potential risk of retinal detachment with the use of oral fluoroquinolones. Health Canada's previous safety review examined the risk of retinal detachment with oral fluoroquinolones and had concluded that limited evidence was available to support a link at that time. Since Health Canada's initial review, many other studies have been conducted regarding the potential link between the use of oral fluoroquinolones and retinal detachment triggering this follow-up safety review. Retinal detachment is a painless separation of the retina from the layer of support tissue and blood vessels at the back of the eye that provides the retina with oxygen and nourishment. Symptoms related to retinal detachment depend on the location and extent of the detachment, and may include the sudden appearance of debris in the field of vision (look like spots, hairs or strings and seem to float across one's vision -- floaters), the perception of flashes of light in the affected eye, the sensation that a shadow or curtain has come down over a portion of the visual field, or even sudden and complete loss of vision in the affected eye. Retinal detachment is considered a medical emergency and requires immediate attention to prevent permanent visual damage. Use in Canada Oral fluoroquinolones are medicines widely used to treat bacterial infections (antibiotics), especially infections of the respiratory and the urogenital system (genitourinary tract). There are five different oral fluoroquinolone drugs marketed in Canada by different companies: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacinFootnote a. Safety Review Findings At the time of the second Health Canada review, there were 3 reports of retinal detachment in CanadaFootnote that were linked to the use of oral fluoroquinolones. A causal relationship between the use of fluoroquinolones and the development of retinal detachment could not be established from these Canadian reports. At the time of the second Health Canada review, 22 reportsFootnote c of retinal detachment linked with oral fluoroquinolones were reported internationally. Two publications (of four observational studies) found a modest link between the occurrence of retinal detachment and the use of fluoroquinolones (8 to 365 days after completion of treatment). Conclusions and Actions Health Canada's follow-up safety review concluded that a link between the use of fluoroquinolones and the occurrence of retinal detachment cannot be ruled out at the present time. Given that retinal detachment is a medical emergency, the recommendations of the review were that the current labeling for oral fluoroquinolones be revised to highlight the urgency to see a health care professional if patients experienced vision problems during or following oral fluoroquinolone administration. Additional Information The analysis that contributed to this safety review included scientific and medical literature, Canadian and international adverse reaction reports and what is known about the use of this drug both in Canada and internationally.
