Fees Report for Fiscal Year 2018 to 2019
Minister’s message
On behalf of Health Canada, I am pleased to present our report on
fees for fiscal year 2018 to 2019, my organization’s second annual
report under the Service Fees Act.
The act provides a modern legislative framework that enables cost-
effective delivery of services and, through better reporting to
Parliament, improves transparency and oversight.
Last year, a detailed listing of individual fees under the department’s
authority, along with anticipated increases, was added to the
reporting requirements.
This year’s report provides more detail on each fee, such as the type and rate of
adjustment, the service standard and the performance result. This information provides
additional context on each fee, in the spirit of open and transparent fee management.
Additionally, this report includes the revision of the fees in respect of drugs and medical
devices. In 2017, Health Canada began engaging with stakeholders to revise fees for
regulatory activities related to human drugs, veterinary drugs, and medical devices and
effective April 1, 2020, fees, where indicated, will be repealed from the Financial
Administration Act and set under the authority of the Food and Drugs Act. In some
instances, new fees are being introduced and some fees are being discontinued.
Cannabis fees were introduced on October 17, 2018 to support the legalization, strict
regulation and restriction on access to cannabis under the Cannabis Act.
I welcome the increased transparency and oversight that the Service Fees Act’s reporting
regime embodies, and I am fully committed to transitioning my department to this
modern framework. I look forward to continuing to advance my key mandate priorities
through collaboration and evidence-based decision-making that will maintain and
improve the health and safety of all Canadians.
The Honourable Patty Hajdu
Minister of Health

Fees Report for Fiscal Year 2018 to 2019
About this report
This report, which is tabled under section 20 of the Service Fees Act and section 4.2.8 of
the Directive on Charging and Special Financial Authorities, contains information about
the fees that Health Canada had the authority to charge in the 2018 to 2019 fiscal year.
This report contains information about all fees that are under Health Canada’s authority,
even if some or all of the fees are collected by another department.
The information reported includes fees that:
 fall under the Service Fees Act
 are exempt from the Service Fees Act
The information covers fees set by:
 contract
 market-base, auction or both
 act, regulation or fees notice
For fees set by the following mechanisms, the report provides totals only:
 contract

For fees set by act, regulation or fees notice, the report provides totals for fee groupings,
as well as detailed information for each individual fee.
Although the fees charged by Health Canada under the Access to Information Act are

Remissions
A remission is a partial or full return of a fee to a fee payer who paid for a service for
which a department deemed that the service standard was not met.
Under the Service Fees Act, departments must develop policies for determining whether a
service standard has been met and for determining how much of a fee will be remitted to
a fee payer. This requirement does not take effect until April 1, 2020. This report

Drug Establishment Licensing Fees
Any person in Canada must obtain a Drug Establishment Licence (DEL) if they are engaged in
any of the six regulated activities (fabricate, import, distribute, wholesale, package/label, and test)
with respect to human and/or veterinary drugs. A fee is charged for the examination of a DEL
application, including all compliance and enforcement and supporting activities needed to ensure
that the applicant/licence holder conforms to all regulatory requirements. The DEL fee is
calculated on a component basis; therefore, the fee amount varies by application. A DEL fee is
charged for the application for a new DEL, an annual licence review of a DEL, certain
amendments to a DEL, reinstatement of a suspended DEL, or re-activation of a cancelled or
withdrawn DEL.
As of April 1, 2020, a more simplified DEL fee regime will be introduced, as indicated in the
tables below.
