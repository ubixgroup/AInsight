The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance with the performance criteria of the ASTM F1816-18, Standard Safety Specification for Drawstrings on Children's Upper Outerwear. For this project, compliance of children's upper outerwear with the ASTM standard was determined through an inspection process by which Health Canada selected relevant products from establishments. Compliance with the performance criteria listed under the Standard was verified by Health Canada inspectors at the time of the inspection. Prior to initiating this CV project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of children's upper outerwear companies in Canada. This effort resulted in a list of importers and manufacturers of these products in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2021-2022 fiscal year, visual evaluation of 46 different samples was performed. The inspections resulted in 23 recalls, four stop sales, one stop distribution, and eight commitments to address a non-compliance. There were 10 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Disclaimer: A systematic bias is applied during inspection and sampling. Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within compliance verification projects are very small, the findings of these projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
