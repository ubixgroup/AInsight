During the fiscal year 2021-22, the program received nearly 3,000 reports from both industry and consumers, as well as over 60,000 cosmetic notifications; some of which led to reactive compliance and enforcement activities. The program also conducted a variety of other compliance verification activities: 324 planned product-based inspections 4,003 monitoring inspections to verify recalled products were not for sale 2,227 referrals from the Canada Border Services Agency, which led to 1,271 shipments into Canada being refused of these shipments, 1,074 were personal and 197 were commercial Overall, the program took corrective action on 505 different non-compliant products. These corrective actions included: 250 voluntary recalls (154 from reported incidents and 96 from inspections), with 7 million units of products recalled in Canada 105 stop sales and 45 stop distributions 28 corrections and 77 commitments Learn about how the program is delivered: About the Consumer Product Safety Program Top recalled consumer product categories These were the top 5 product categories for recalled consumer products: clothing, textiles and accessories (21%) children's products (15%) housewares (14%) outdoor living (13%) home & automobile maintenance (11%) Working with international partners Health Canada continues to work with other countries to publish joint recalls. Canada's Consumer Product Safety Program and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) had 55 joint recalls in 2021-22. This affected close to 18.1 million units. In collaboration with the U.S. CPSC and Mexico's Consumer Protection Federal Agency (known as PROFECO), the program conducted 2 tri-lateral recalls in 2021-22. This affected 3.6 million units. Targeted inspections Table 1 includes product inspection activities that were completed by March 31, 2022. Inspection activities that started in 2021-22 but weren't completed by March 31, 2022, will be captured in the next annual report. Details on the results of the individual projects are found in the enforcement summary reports. Publication of these reports is part of the Government of Canada's commitment to regulatory transparency and openness. Table 1.

We are also able to keep consumers informed about health and safety issues related to consumer products and cosmetics. We will use the information from 2021-22 compliance verification activities and the reports we received from consumers and industry to plan future activities. This information will help the federal government target product safety risks to better protect the health and safety of consumers.
