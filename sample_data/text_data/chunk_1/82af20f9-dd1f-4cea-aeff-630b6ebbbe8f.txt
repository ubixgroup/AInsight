The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of vaping products subject to the CCPSA with the requirements of the Vaping Products Labelling and Packaging Regulations (VPLPR). Specifically, refillable vaping devices and refillable vaping device parts are required to be child-resistant. This project evaluated device compliance to this requirement. Prior to initiating this CV project, the Tobacco and Vaping Compliance and Enforcement Program carried out a market survey to create a list of companies selling vaping products in Canada. Some targets were then selected from that list. For this project, compliance of select vaping products with the VPLPR was determined through a review of documents requested from the regulated parties by Health Canada inspectors, from which child-resistant testing data was evaluated for 17 products. The compliance verification inspections resulted in zero instances in which corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, the findings of CV projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually evaluated and the specific criteria indicated. Review by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
