Key Messages (2-3 bullets max)
The implementation of digital health solutions (DHS) into clinical practices facilitate improvements within
the integrated healthcare model. In order to realize DHS benefits, developing an integrated healthcare
system that promotes greater connection, collaboration and communication is essential.
A standardized approach in assessing digital health technologies (DHTs), alongside guidance on evidence
standards for researchers and innovators, could improve decision making about, and investments into,
DHTs and ensure that new DHTs are clinically effective while offering value to the health care system.
A standardized framework would assist health policymakers in the development of regulatory, clinical,
and pricing and reimbursement guidelines for digital health solutions in a similar fashion to those that
are already in place (e.g. for both pharmaceuticals and medical devices).
Purpose /Objectives (2-3 bullets max)
Health Canada will fund an OECD project to strengthen the use of DHTs through the creation of a
common/standardized framework, leveraging international evidence and best practices to support,
strengthen and transform current health public systems.
The standardized framework will support consistent DHT research, regulatory, and implementation
practices that should allow for comparable data and interoperability across countries.
The framework will also develop a set of specific evidence standards for DHTs to facilitate effective and
equitable evaluation strategies and reimbursement decisions.
Expected Results (2-3 bullets max)
The project will explore gaps and best practices in current regulations and evaluation frameworks, and
identify challenges and opportunities including by reviewing international models and approaches.
It will establish a robust digital health assessment methodology with an identification of the necessary
criteria for evaluating DHTs and what constitutes suitable evidence.
It will support the creation of universal digital health interoperability standards to address the issues in
the lack of interoperability as critical barrier for the adoption of digital health technologies.

antimicrobial use (AMU) in food producing animals and summarize, including perspectives of food
producers and veterinary professionals, as well as the consumer perspective (awareness/expectations)
on AMR/AMU in food producing animals.
Purpose /Objectives
The purpose of this funding is to:
Support the implementation of PCAP, and to have a better understanding of how AMR in food producing
animals impacts human health, and an understanding of what approaches or interventions could
improve prudent use of antimicrobials in food producing animals within the Canadian context are
needed; and
For CFIA to undertake an assessment and summarize what is currently known about how AMR in food
producing animals impacts human health, and assessment of best practices to inform the kinds of
changes needed to make a significant difference to further enhance the prudent use of antimicrobials (in
particular, medically important antimicrobials) in food-producing animals, and how those changes might
be systemically achieved in the Canadian context.
Expected Results
Expected results include:
Increased knowledge of the impacts of exposure to AMR in enteric/foodborne pathogens on human
health and meaningful interventions to enhance the responsible use of antimicrobials in food-producing
animals within the Canadian context;
Understanding of consumer and stakeholder perceptions of antimicrobial use in food-producing animals
and opportunities to strengthen public education and promote antimicrobial stewardship; and,
Provision of additional evidence and identification of opportunities to take further action under PCAP.
This may include information to support the development of baselines and goals for reduction of AMU in
animals.

Transfer to the Department of Employment and Social Development to support activities related to the
Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Transformation Initiative
($890,149)
Key Messages
Budget 2021 announced further incremental funding increases for Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and
Northern Communities (AHSUNC) Program over the next five years (2021-22 to 2025-26) to better
support Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care (IELCC) in urban and northern communities. The
allocation of this funding will be determined by the National Aboriginal Head Start Council (NAHSC), in
consultation with other regional bodies.
This horizontal initiative is led by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) and includes
Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada
(CIRNAC).
To support this work, the partners have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that sets out
the terms and conditions for the transfer of funds between ESDC, PHAC and ISC for the IELCC
Transformation Initiative.
Purpose /Objectives
The Agency received dedicated funding for AHSUNC in anticipation of funding decisions to be made by
Regional Partnership Tables for Alberta, Quebec and the Atlantic. Funding decisions have now been
made by Indigenous recipients and an amount of $890,149 was not allocated to the AHSUNC program.
Based on the MOU, funds should be returned to ESDC so that they can be consolidated and potentially
reprofiled into the next fiscal year.
The funds being transferred represent a return of funding under the MOU to implement decisions made
by Indigenous partners (Alberta, Quebec and Atlantic) in Fall 2023.
Expected Results
As noted in the IELCC Framework and through the Transformation Initiative, it is expected that AHSUNC
will be Indigenous-led and aligned with the principles of Indigenous reconciliation.
