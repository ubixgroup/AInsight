Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation Supplementary Estimates B
Issue
CMHC Supplementary Estimates B includes increases in funding for the Rental Construction Financing
Initiative and the Federal Community Housing Initiative Phase II
Response
Rental Construction Financing Initiative
 Supply needs to keep pace with demand. This is why the Rental Construction Financing
initiative encourages the construction of rental housing by providing low-cost loans to support
projects in areas where there is a need for additional rental supply.
 The initiative provides almost 26 billion in loans that will run until 2028 for the construction of
more than 71,000 rental units in communities across Canada.
 Projects under the initiative can offer affordable residential rents, accessible units, greater
energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and can demonstrate long-term
financial viability.
Federal Community Housing Initiative Phase II
 Our government is taking concrete actions to protect the most vulnerable Canadians and
ensure that Canada’s community housing stock remains affordable and viable well into the
future.
 We are investing $500 million over 10 years in the Federal Community Housing Initiative. The
initiative will protect tenants and stabilize the operations of more than 55,000 units in
federally administered community housing projects.
 In addition to these investments, Budget 2021 proposed an additional $118.2 million over
seven years, starting in 2021-22, through the Federal Community Housing Initiative, to
support community housing providers that deliver long-term housing to many of our most
vulnerable people. This funding will support an additional 2,700 low-income units.
Background
Rental Construction Financing Initiative
The Rental Construction Financing (RCFI) provides low-cost loans to encourage the construction of rental
housing across Canada. It supports sustainable apartment projects in areas where there is a need for
additional rental supply. The initiative has a total of $25.75 billion in available loans for the construction
of 71,000 units, and is open from 2017 to the end of 2028.
The funding of $43.6 million in 2021-22 will be used towards administrative costs and insurance
premiums.
As of September 30, 2021, over $12.3 billion have been committed under the RCFi to support the
creation of over 34,600 units, of which close to 23,800 will be affordable.
Federal Community Housing Initiative Phase II
Phase 2 of the Federal Community Housing Initiative is not an extension or continuation of other
programs or of prior agreements. It will provide rental assistance funding from September 1, 2020 until
March 31, 2028. In the light of the COVID 19 pandemic, the launch date for the phase 2 of the Federal
Community Housing initiative was delayed from April 1, 2020 to September 1, 2020. We’ve made sure
that current levels of financial assistance were maintained until the end of August 2020.
The funding of $8.3M for 2021 is part of a top-up of $105 million in funding over 7 years, with an
additional $13.2M in administration costs, to extend eligibility for the Federal Community Housing
Initiative Phase 2 program to those former federally administered community housing co-operatives and
non-profit housing providers whose agreements expired prior to April 1, 2016 (pre-2016). The estimate
of units supported through this top-up is up to 2,700 community-housing units, including co-operatives.
As of September 30, 2021, phase II has provided over $29,4M in rent assistance to over 5,900 low
income units.
National Housing Strategy
Issue
What is the status of Initiatives under the National Housing Strategy?
Response
 Mr. Speaker, as we all learned and experienced during the COVID 19 pandemic, home is a
sanctuary - a place of safety and refuge. That is why our government is working to ensure that
every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home.
 The Government’s National Housing Strategy is 10‑year, $72+ billion plan that will give more
Canadians a place to call home.
 The NHS delivers concrete results. It helps to create over 125,000 new housing units and
repair another 300,000. It is removing as many as 530,000 households from housing need.
 The NHS is helping those most in need, including women and children fleeing situations of
domestic violence; seniors; Indigenous peoples; persons with disabilities; those dealing with
mental health and addiction issues; veterans; and young adults.

National Housing Co-Investment Fund
Issue
What is the government doing to ensure housing is available for Canadians in need?
Response
 The $13.2 billion National Housing Co-Investment Fund is at the core of the National Housing
Strategy. Our government is working with partners across the country to invest in the growth
of livable communities and contribute to the resilience of the community housing sector.
 The National Housing Co-Investment Fund will build up to 60,000 new homes and repair up to
240,000 units of existing affordable and community housing.
 It also supports more shelter spaces for survivors of violence, transitional and supportive
housing, and new ways to make homeownership more affordable.
 Budget 2021 has notably set aside $250 million in the National Housing Co-Investment Fund to
support the construction, repair, and operating costs of an estimated 560 units of transitional
housing and shelter spaces for women and children fleeing violence.
 Mr. Speaker, I’m please to report that as of September 30, 2021, over $3.0 billion in low-cost
loans and over $1.6 billion in contributions have been committed for over 108,700 new and
repaired units.
Background
To ensure existing rental housing is not lost to disrepair and to develop new, high-performing affordable
housing that is located close to necessary supports and amenities, from public transit and jobs to
daycare, schools, and healthcare, the federal government is creating a $13.2 billion federally-managed
National Housing Co-Investment Fund. The National Housing Co-Investment Fund consists of $4.52
billion in grants and $8.65 billion in low-interest loans.
The National Housing Co-Investment Fund will attract partnerships with, and investments from the
provinces and territories, municipalities, non-profits and co-operatives, and the private sector, to focus
on new construction and the preservation and renewal of the existing affordable housing supply. The
National Housing Co-Investment Fund will support more shelter spaces for survivors of family violence,
transitional and supportive housing, new and renewed affordable and community housing, and ways of
making homeownership more affordable. It will also support Canada’s climate change goals, as well as
improve accessibility of housing for people with disabilities, by promoting universal design and
visitability. The National Housing Co-Investment Fund will also align with public investment in job
creation, skills training, transit, early learning, health care, and cultural and recreational infrastructure.
As the National Housing Co-Investment Fund is established the federal government will work closely
with provinces and territories to ensure housing investments are well coordinated and aligned.
To maximize the impact of the Fund, the Government will also combine contributions and loans with the
transfer of federal lands to affordable and community housing providers. Over the next 10 years, up to
$200 million in federal lands will be transferred to housing providers to encourage the development of
sustainable, accessible, mixed-income, mixed-use developments and communities.
In addition to these new investments, Budget 2021 proposes to advance and reallocate, on a cash basis,
of previously announced funding, including:
- $750 million in funding under the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, which is proposed to be
advanced to 2021-22 and 2022-23. This will accelerate the creation of 3,400 new units, and the repair of
13,700 units.
- $250 million in funding under the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, which will be allocated to
support the construction, repair, and operating costs of an estimated 560 units of transitional housing
and shelter spaces for women and children fleeing violence. This targeted funding is being reallocated—
including advancing $200 million to 2021- 22 and 2022-23—to make sure the government delivers on its
commitments, and reinforces the government’s efforts to address gender-based violence, including the
measures outlined in the forthcoming National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence.
Rapid Housing Initiative
Issue
What is the aim of the Rapid Housing Initiative?
Response
 As we are all still dealing with the impacts of the pandemic, one thing as become clear: our
homes have become a sanctuary - a place of safety and refuge. That is why the Government of
Canada is working to ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home.
 The initial $1 billion Rapid Housing Initiative has exceeded its original target and will now
create more than 4,700 new permanent units of affordable housing across Canada, of
which 1,836 are for Indigenous peoples.
 Budget 2021 committed an additional $1.5 billion for the Rapid Housing Initiative to add a
minimum of 4,500 new affordable units to address the urgent housing needs of vulnerable
Canadians.
 At least 25 per cent of this new funding would go towards women-focused housing projects.
 This initiative, delivered in tandem with the National Housing Strategy (NHS), addresses
urgent housing needs for vulnerable Canadians by rapidly creating new affordable housing.
Background
Round 1: The Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) a $1 billion program to help address urgent housing needs of
vulnerable Canadians, especially in the context of COVID-19, through the rapid construction of
affordable housing.
The initiative provided capital contributions (upon signing a funding agreement with CMHC) under two
streams to expedite the delivery of affordable housing. The RHI will:
 Support the creation of up to 3,000 (exceeded target to 4,787 new permanent affordable
housing units)
 Cover the construction of modular housing, as well as the acquisition of land, and the
conversion/rehabilitation of existing buildings to affordable housing
 Aim to commit all funds before March 31, 2021, and ensure housing is available within 12
months of agreements
The initial $1B investment is divided into two equal funding streams:
 The RHI Major Cities Stream provided $500 million in immediate support to 15 pre-determined
municipalities that were identified in consultation with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities
(FCM), based on highest levels of renters in severe housing need and people experiencing
homelessness.
 Under the $500 million Projects Stream, provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous
governing bodies and organizations, and non-profit organizations could apply for funding by
December 31, 2020. The RHI received a significant amount of interest, resulting in a high
number of quality applications that far exceeded the available funding.
Round 2: Budget 2021 committed $1.5 billion for the RHI in 2021-22 to address the urgent housing
needs of vulnerable Canadians by providing them with adequate affordable housing in short order.
 At least 25 per cent of this funding would go towards women-focused housing projects.
 $500 million will be allocated to a Cities Stream and flow to 30 pre-determined
municipalities.
 1$ billion will be allocated to unfunded eligible projects from Round 1.
Overall, this new funding will add a minimum of 4,500 new affordable units to Canada’s housing supply.

Background
A. VOTED APPROPRIATION
1. Funding to implement the Social Finance Fund (Budget 2021) – $113.5 million
The Government of Canada first committed to establish measures under the Social Innovation and Social
Finance Strategy (including the $50 million Investment Readiness Pilot Program, a $755 million Social
Finance Fund, and a Social Innovation and Advisory Council) in 2018, in response to the
recommendations of the Social Innovation and Social finance Strategy Co-Creation Steering Group.
The Social Finance Fund (SFF) is a $755 million initiative that seeks to accelerate the growth of Canada’s
social finance market and provide greater access to flexible financing opportunities in order to help
social purpose organizations grow, innovate, and enhance their social and environmental impacts. The
COVID-19 pandemic delayed the planned 2020 launch of the Fund.
Budget 2021 announced an accelerated SFF, which provided for a frontloading of up to $220 million to
be invested in the program’s first two years (2021–22 and 2022–23) in order to support near-term
economic and social recovery.
Key design parameters for the SFF, first announced in the 2018 Fall Economic Statement and Budget
2019, remain unchanged.
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) has a tight critical path to identify a successful
wholesaler(s) and ensure that an up-front multi-year contribution agreement(s) is in place in March
2022, allowing the Department to advance $110 million before March 31, 2022.
ESDC is requesting authority to include $3,528,964 in Vote 1 (Operating expenditures, excluding
employee benefit plan (EBP) costs of $404,985) and $110,000,000 in Vote 5 (Contributions) to
Implement the Social Finance Fund as part of the 2021–22 Supplementary Estimates (B).
2. Funding for onboarding activities by Old Age Security processing operations for the Benefit
Delivery Modernization (Budget 2021) – $0.8 million
The more than 6.7 million Old Age Security (OAS) clients provide Employment and Social Development
Canada (ESDC) with personal information such as address and direct deposit details.
The OAS client relationship extends for many years, into decades, and this information changes over
time. Under normal circumstances, any time a client contacts ESDC or benefit changes are made, this
information is validated by the staff member working with the client.
In order to prepare for the upcoming move to a new system, ESDC is validating this client information
against Canada Pension Plan and Social Insurance Registry data. Since these programs are on different
systems, they are not able to share information automatically.
Existing information discrepancies would show up as data errors while being moved to the new system.
This will delay the process and add expenses. As such, ESDC is proactively validating this data to
minimize any potential disruptions while moving to the new system.
ESDC is requesting authority to include $830,837 in Vote 1 (Operating expenditures, excluding employee
benefit plan (EBP) costs of $217,630) for onboarding activities by Old Age Security processing operations
for the Benefits Delivery Modernization as part of the 2021–22 Supplementary Estimates (B).
B. TRANSFERS
1. Internal reallocation of resources from contributions ($12,500,000) to the Enabling
Accessibility Fund Small Projects Grant
The objective of the Enabling Accessibility Fund (EAF) is to support community-based projects across
Canada that improve accessibility, remove barriers, and enable Canadians with disabilities to participate
in and contribute to their community and the labour market.
The Establishment of a Canada-wide Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) System Treasury Board
Submission provided contribution funding through the EAF to improve the physical accessibility of
childcare centres in Canada.
The funding provided to the EAF to support ELCC centres will be disbursed through the small projects
component of EAF, with a maximum of $70,000 of funding per eligible project. As the EAF program
Terms and Conditions allow for funding under $100,000 to be distributed as grants, it is requested that
the funds to support the ELCC-EAF call for proposal (CFP) be transferred from contribution funding to
grant funding. The ELCC CFP is scheduled to launch in autumn 2021 following Ministerial review and
approval.
ESDC is requesting authority to include an internal reallocation of $12,500,000 in Vote 5 from
contributions to Enabling Accessibility Fund Small Projects Grant as part of the 2021–22 Supplementary
Estimates (B). This internal reallocation does not increase the department’s Vote 5 funding.
2. Transfer from the Department of Employment and Social Development to the Department of
Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs to support Indigenous Early Learning and
Child Care – $1.6 million
The funding transfer of $1.6 million from ESDC to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs
Canada (CIRNAC) reflects Canada’s commitment to support Indigenous governments, such as the
Nunatsiavut Government, in the implementation of their self-governing agreements, including
provisions relating to the delivery of Inuit Early Learning and Child Care programs for fiscal year 2021–
22.
Provision of funding to the Nunatsiavut Government will assist the Department to achieve objectives set
out in the Inuit Early Learning and Child Care Framework.
ESDC is requesting authority to include a transfer of $1,636,029 in Vote 5 (Grants and Contributions) to
the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs to support Indigenous Early
Learning and Child Care as part of the 2021–22 Supplementary Estimates (B).
3. Transfer from the Department of Employment and Social Development to Crown-Indigenous
Relations and Northern Affairs Canada to support Indigenous Skills and Employment Training
– $6.0 million
To continue to support the development of the Indigenous labour market, Budget 2018 invested $2
billion over five years and $408.2 million per year ongoing to support the creation of the Indigenous
Skills and Employment Training (ISET) program. This was augmented by the announcement of an
additional $144.2 million in 2021-2022 in the 2020 Fall Economic Statement.
The objective of the ISET program is to reduce the employment and skills gaps between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous people, focusing on moving clients along the skills continuum and supporting them in
achieving their employment goals.
Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs (CIRNAC) currently provides the Consolidated Revenue
Fund (CRF) portion of the ISET program to 18 Self-Governing Indigenous Governments as a grant. This
funding approach aligns with the government’s stated objectives to advance reconciliation and promote
Indigenous self-determination.
The adoption of this approach allows Self-Governing Indigenous Governments to have maximum
flexibility in the use of funds and in the design of training and employment programs according to their
priorities. Additionally, the administrative reporting burden is greatly reduced under this model and
respects these Indigenous governments’ accountability to their citizens in addition to Canada.
Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is requesting authority to include a transfer of
$6,034,801 in Vote 5 (Grants and Contributions) to the Department of Crown-Indigenous Relations and
Northern Affairs to support Indigenous Skills and Employment Training as part of the 2021–22
Supplementary Estimates (B).
C. STATUTORY BUDGETARY AUTHORITIES
1. Increase to Payments for the Canada Recovery Benefit pursuant to the Canada Recovery
Benefits Act – $1.9 billion
On March 18, 2021, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number
of weeks available under the Canadian Recovery Benefit (CRB) from 26 to 38 weeks. Budget 2021
further increased the number of weeks available under the CRB by an additional 12 weeks to a
maximum of 50 weeks. The CRB was extended again to 54 weeks on July 30, 2021 and made available
until October 23, 2021.
As of October 15, 2021, over 2.2 million workers have accessed the CRB, at a total gross dollar value of
$27 billion.
The forecasted increase of $1.9 billion presented through the Supplementary Estimates (B) is reflective
of the extension of income support available from a maximum of 50 to a maximum of 54 weeks, as well
as revised projected take-up rates based on take-up to date.
2. Increase to Payments for the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit pursuant to the Canada
Recovery Benefits Act – $1.4 billion
On March 18, 2021, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number
of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) by 12 weeks (up from 26 weeks
to 38 weeks) came into effect. The number of weeks available under the CRCB was further extended
from 38 to 42 weeks on June 29, 2021.
Budget 2021 included authorities that allow extension of the CRCB window until November 20, 2021
through regulations. In August 2021, these authorities were leveraged to extend the benefit window for
the CRCB from September 25, 2021 to October 23, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Government of
Canada proposed to further extend the CRCB until May 7, 2022 and an increase to the maximum
duration of benefits by an additional 2 weeks, from 42 weeks to 44 weeks.
As a first step, the benefit window for the CRCB was extended from October 23, 2021 to
November 20, 2021. This extension will ensure there is no gap in coverage for applicants claiming the
CRCB for the period after October 23, 2021. Any extension beyond November 20, 2021 requires
parliamentary approval.
As of October 15, 2021, approximately 468,340 workers have received CRCB, a total gross dollar value of
$3.61 billion.
The forecasted increase of $1.4 billion presented through the Supplementary Estimates (B) is reflective
of the proposed extension to the benefit window until May 7, 2022, the proposed extension in the
maximum number of weeks of benefits available from 42 to 44 weeks, as well as revised projected take-
up rates based on take-up to date.
3. Increase to Payments for the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit pursuant to the Canada
Recovery Benefits Act – $523.7 million
On March 18, 2021, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number
of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) from 2 to 4 weeks came into
effect.
Budget 2021 included authorities that allow to extend the CRSB window until November 20, 2021
through regulations. In August 2021, these authorities were leveraged to extend the benefit window for
the CRSB from September 25, 2021 to October 23, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Government of
Canada proposed to further extend the CRSB until May 7, 2022 and increase the maximum duration of
benefits by an additional 2 weeks, from 4 weeks to 6 weeks.
As a first step, the benefit window for the CRSB was extended from October 23, 2021 to
November 20, 2021. This extension will ensure there is no gap in coverage for applicants claiming the
CRSB for the period after October 23, 2021. Any extension beyond November 20, 2021 requires
parliamentary approval.
As of October 15, 2021, approximately 704,780 workers received the CRSB, a total gross dollar value of
$751 million.
The forecasted increase of $523.7 million presented through the Supplementary Estimates (B) is
reflective of the proposed extension to the benefit window until May 7, 2022, the proposed extension in
the maximum number of weeks of benefits available from 4 to 6 weeks, as well as and revised projected
take-up rates based on take-up to date.
4. Increase to Contributions to Employee Benefit Plans (EBP) – $0.6 million
Contributions to employee benefit plans (EBP) include costs to the government for the employer’s
matching contributions and payments to the Public Service Superannuation Plan, the Canada and the
Quebec Pension Plans, death benefits, and the Employment Insurance Operating Account.
An increase of $622,615 to EBP costs is related to two items requested in these Supplementary
Estimates:
 Funding to implement the Social Finance Fund (Budget 2021) ($404,985); and
 Funding for onboarding activities by Old Age Security processing operations for the
Benefits Delivery Modernization (Budget 2021) ($217,630).
Tabling of Employment and Social Development Canada’s Supplementary Estimates (B) for Fiscal Year
Ending March 31, 2022
Issue
Why is Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) requesting an increase of $1,867.9 million
for the Canada Recovery Benefit pursuant to the Canada Recovery Benefits Act in the Supplementary
Estimates (B) for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022?
Response
 In September 2020, we transitioned to a simplified and more accessible EI Program and
introduced three new temporary recovery benefits to ensure that Canadians continue to receive
the support they need when their employment is affected by COVID-19.
 The Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) is one of those three benefits, delivered by the Canada
Revenue Agency.
 Initially, the CRB was set to end on September 25, 2021; however, recognizing the continued
economic impact of the pandemic, it was extended until October 23, 2021.
 As of October 15, 2021, over 2.2 million workers have accessed the CRB, a total gross dollar
value of $27 billion.
 The additional funding requested through the Supplementary Estimates (B) is reflective of the
extension of income support available from a maximum of 50 to a maximum of 54 weeks, as
well as revised projected take-up rates based on take-up to date.
Background
On October 2, 2020, the Government announced the introduction of three temporary recovery benefits
to support Canadians who are unable to work due to COVID-19.
On March 18, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number of
weeks available under the Canadian Recovery Benefit (CRB) from 26 to 38 weeks. Budget 2021 further
increased the number of weeks available under the CRB by an additional 12 weeks to a maximum of 50
weeks. The CRB was extended again to 54 weeks on July 30, 2021 and made available until October 23,
2021.
By increasing the number of weeks of benefits available through EI and the CRB, the Government of
Canada supported workers through the next phase of the post-pandemic recovery.
The CRB provided a weekly benefit amount of $500 paid for up to 42 weeks. Claimants who had already
received CRB payments for 42 weeks and new CRB claimants as of July 18, 2021 received a weekly
benefit of $300 for up to 54 weeks. The CRB was available to those who were not eligible for EI and were
not employed or self-employed due to COVID-19, or had had their employment/self-employment
income reduced due to COVID-19.
The Canada Recovery Benefit was available to residents in Canada who:
 Were at least 15 years old and who had a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN);
 Were not employed or self-employed for reasons related to COVID-19 pandemic and were
available and looking for work; or were working and had their employment/self-employment
income reduced by at least 50% due to COVID-19;
 Were not eligible for Employment Insurance;
 Had employment and/or self-employment income of at least $5,000 in 2019 or in 2020, or in the
12-month period prior to their first application for the Canada Recovery Benefit;
 Had not quit their job voluntarily; and
 Had not rejected a reasonable job offer, rejected a request to resume work or failed to resume
work if self-employed where reasonable to do so.
Workers were required to apply after every 2-week period for which they are seeking income support
and attest that they continue to meet the requirements. This benefit is taxable.
Applicants were required to seek and accept work, when it was reasonable for them to do so.
Applicants who received the CRB and have an annual net income greater than $38,000 will be required
to repay some or all of the benefit through the tax filing process.
As of October 10, 2021, the total gross dollar value of CRB (before taxes are withheld) is $27 billion. The
CRA withholds a 10% tax at source for each CRB payment issued.

Tabling of Employment and Social Development Canada’s Supplementary Estimates (B) for Fiscal Year
Ending March 31, 2022
Issue
Why is Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) requesting an increase of $1,416.4 million
for the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit pursuant to the Canada Recovery Benefits Act in the
Supplementary Estimates (B) for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022?
Response
 Last September, we transitioned to a temporary simplified and more accessible EI Program and
introduced three new temporary recovery benefits to ensure that Canadians continue to receive
the support they need when their employment is affected by COVID-19.
 The Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) is one of those three benefits, delivered by the
Canada Revenue Agency.
 The CRCB currently provides $500 per week for up to 42 weeks (an increase of four weeks) for
workers who are unable to work at least 50% of their normal work schedule because they must
stay home to provide care to a young child or a family member who requires supervision when
the school or facility is closed due to COVID-19 or the child or family member cannot attend due
to COVID-19.
 As COVID public health measures remain in place, the government announced on October 21,
2021 a proposed extension of the CRCB until May 7 2022, as well as an additional 2 weeks of
entitlement up to a maximum of 44 weeks, to ensure that workers continue to have income
support if they cannot work because they need to provide care to a child or a family member.
 As of October 15, 2021, approximately 468,340 workers have received CRCB, a total gross dollar
value of $3.61 billion.
 This funding estimate is reflective of the proposed extension to the benefit window until May 7,
2022, the proposed extension in the maximum number of weeks of benefits available from 42 to
44 weeks, as well as revised projected take-up rates based on take-up to date.
Background
On October 2, 2020, the Government announced the introduction of three temporary recovery benefits
to support Canadians who are unable to work due to COVID-19.
On March 18, 2021, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number
of weeks available under the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) by 12 weeks (up from 26 weeks
to 38 weeks) came into effect. The number of weeks available under the CRCB was further extended
from 38 to 42 weeks on June 29, 2021.
Budget 2021 included authorities that allow extension of the CRCB window until November 20, 2021
through regulations. In August 2021, these authorities were leveraged to extend the benefit window for
the CRCB from September 25, 2021 to October 23, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Government of
Canada proposed to further extend the CRCB until May 7, 2022 and an increase to the maximum
duration of benefits by an additional 2 weeks, from 42 weeks to 44 weeks.
As a first step, the benefit window for the CRCB was extended from October 23, 2021 to November 20,
2021. This extension will ensure there is no gap in coverage for applicants claiming the CRCB for the
period after October 23, 2021. Any extension beyond November 20, 2021 requires parliamentary
approval.
The CRCB currently provides $500 per week for up to 42 weeks between September 27, 2020 and
November 20, 2021 to persons who have been unable to work a minimum of 50% of their scheduled
work week because they had to care for a child under the age of 12 or another family member who
requires supervised care because:
 their school, daycare, day program, or care facility that they normally attend is unavailable,
closed or open only certain times or for certain individuals; or
 the care services or the person who usually cares for the child or family member is not available
due to COVID-19; or
 they are sick or have symptoms of COVID-19 and/or have been directed to self-isolate or
quarantine for reasons related to COVID-19; or
 they are at high risk of serious health complications if they contracted COVID-19.
In addition, applicants must be residing in Canada and:
 be at least 15 years of age on the first day of the period for which they are applying for the
benefit;
 have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN);
 be employed or self-employed at the time of the application;
 have earned at least $5,000 in 2019 or 2020, or in the 12 months preceding the day of their
application;
Workers are not eligible if they are in receipt of the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery
Sickness Benefit (CRSB), short-term disability benefits, workers’ compensation benefits, or any EI
benefits or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) benefits in the same respective week.
Workers are not eligible if they have, in respect of the same week, been granted paid leave or have been
paid under a plan that provides for payment for the care or support to another person.
A maximum of 42 weeks is available per household (available in 42 one-week periods). Only one
individual per household may apply for the CRCB at any time.
The CRCB is delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency and is taxable with taxes deducted at source.

Why is Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) requesting an increase of $523.7 million for
the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit pursuant to the Canada Recovery Benefits Act in the
Supplementary Estimates (B) for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022?
Response
 Last September, we transitioned to a temporary simplified and more accessible EI Program and
we introduced three new temporary recovery benefits to ensure that Canadians continue to
receive the support they need when their employment is affected by COVID-19.
 The Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) is one of those three benefits, delivered by the

more susceptible to COVID-19.
 As public health measures remain in place, to ensure that impacted workers continue to have
income support during the pandemic, the Government announced on October 21, 2021 a
proposed extension of the CRSB until May 7, 2022 and an increase in the maximum duration of
benefits by an additional 2 weeks, from 4 weeks to 6 weeks.
 As of October 15, 2021, approximately 704,780 workers received the CRSB, a total gross dollar
value of $751 million.
 This funding estimate for 2021-22 is reflective of the proposed extension to the benefit window
until May 7, 2021, the proposed extension in the maximum number of weeks of benefits
available from 4 to 6 weeks, as well as and revised projected take-up rates based on take-up to
date.
Background
On October 2, 2020, the Government announced the introduction of three temporary recovery benefits
to support Canadians unable to work due to COVID-19.
On March 18, the Government of Canada announced that new regulations to increase the number of
weeks available under the CRSB from 2 to 4 weeks came into effect.
Budget 2021 included authorities that allow to extend the CRSB window until November 20, 2021

approval.
The CRSB currently provides $500 per week for up to 4 weeks (available in 4 one-week periods) between
September 27, 2020 and November 20, 2021 to persons who have been unable to work a minimum of
50% of their scheduled work week because they are sick with COVID-19, are advised to self-isolate due
to COVID-19, or have underlying conditions, are undergoing treatments or have contracted another
illness that will make them more susceptible to COVID-19.
In addition, applicants must be residing in Canada and:

any EI benefits or Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP) benefits in respect of the same week.
Workers are not eligible if they have, in respect of the same week, been granted paid leave or have been
paid under a sickness benefit plan.
A person does not have to use up the paid sick leave provided by employers, provinces and territories
and/or EI sickness benefit before they can apply to the CRSB. However, a person my not claim the CRSB
for the same period in which they are receiving any EI benefits or another form of paid leave.

Tabling of Employment and Social Development Canada’s Supplementary Estimates (B) for Fiscal Year

Issue
Why is Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) requesting $113.5 million to implement the
Social Finance Fund in the Supplementary Estimates (B) for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022?
Response
 ESDC is seeking $113.5 million in Supplementary Estimates (B) to begin implementation of the
$755 million Social Finance Fund, an initiative first announced by the Government of Canada in
2018 to support the growth of Canada’s social finance market, but whose 2020 implementation
was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Recognizing the Social Finance Fund’s potential role in supporting the country’s economic and
social recovery, the Government of Canada announced the acceleration of the Fund in Budget
2021 through a front-loading of $220 million for its first two years of implementation: $110
million in 2021–22 and another $110 million in 2022–23.
 Of the $113.5 million being sought through Supplementary Estimates (B), $110 million will be
distributed to a small number of professional investment manager(s) (what we are calling
wholesaler(s). The wholesaler or wholesalers will be responsible for investing in social purpose
organizations through existing and emerging social finance intermediary organizations. ESDC will
use the remaining $3.5 million to cover internal costs related to the Fund’s operation and
management.
 The Government of Canada is currently working to identify a wholesaler(s) to implement the
Social Finance Fund through a merit-based, open, and competitive selection process, with the
support and advice of external fund management experts. This process is expected to result in
the signing of up-front multi-year contribution agreement(s) with selected wholesaler(s) in
February or March of 2022.
 The use of an up-front multi-year contribution agreement will ensure that funds for the Social
Finance Fund are deployed by March 31st, 2022, and provide the wholesaler(s) with the
flexibility to use whatever funds necessary for initial start-up costs while carrying forward any
unused funds to the next fiscal year.
 This approach ensures no further delays in the implementation of the Social Finance Fund and
aligns with the Government of Canada’s intentions to accelerate the Fund.
Background
The Government of Canada first committed to establish measures under the Social Innovation and Social
Finance Strategy – including the $50 million Investment Readiness Pilot Program, a $755 million Social
Finance Fund, and a Social Innovation and Advisory Council – in 2018, in response to the
recommendations of the Social Innovation and Social finance Strategy Co-Creation Steering Group.
The Social Finance Fund is a $755 million initiative that seeks to accelerate the growth of Canada’s social
finance market and provide greater access to flexible financing opportunities in order to help social
purpose organizations grow, innovate, and enhance their social and environmental impacts. The COVID-
19 pandemic delayed the planned 2020 launch of the Fund.
Budget 2021 announced an accelerated Social Finance Fund, which provided for a frontloading of up to
$220 million to be invested in the program’s first two years (2021–22 and 2022–23) in order to support
near-term economic and social recovery.
Key design parameters for the Social Finance Fund, first announced in the 2018 Fall Economic Statement
and Budget 2019, remain unchanged, including that:
 Funding will be managed through a professional investment manager(s) with expertise in social
impact reporting and a proven ability to promote inclusive growth and diversity in the social
finance market.
 The fund manager(s) will invest in existing or emerging social finance intermediary organizations
that have leveraged private or philanthropic capital for co-investment.
 $50 million of the Social Finance Fund will be invested in the Indigenous Growth Fund
administered by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association.
The Government of Canada launched an open, public, and competitive selection process for professional
investment managers to become a wholesaler of the fund on August 13th 2021 and closed on
September 30th. The proposals received are currently being assessed.
ESDC has a tight critical path to identify a successful wholesaler(s) and ensure that an up-front multi-
year contribution agreement(s) is in place in March 2022, allowing the Department to advance $110
million before March 31st, 2022. The contribution agreement(s) will schedule annual disbursements of
funds from ESDC to the wholesaler(s), for at least the first five years. The wholesaler(s) will be permitted
to carry forward unexpended funds from year to year, under the parameters set out in the contribution
agreements, but this will be balanced against the need to invest funds as quickly as possible in order to
ensure that social finance intermediaries have sufficient time to invest into social purpose organizations.

SUPPORT FOR DISASTER MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION
Issue
Support through Infrastructure Canada for disaster mitigation and adaptation projects.
Response
 People in BC, Nunavut and in the Atlantic have seen first-hand the effects of our changing
climate – wildfires, floods, and melting permafrost have affected Canadians in ways that are
hard to describe or understand.
 The Government of Canada is committed to supporting Canadian communities, from response
to rebuild, to long term resiliency, they mitigate and adapt to the frequent and intensifying
weather events that are associated with climate change.
 That is why the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, the Disaster Mitigation and
Adaptation Fund and the Canada Community-Building Fund are investing in disaster mitigation
adaptation – to build resilient communities and reduce the impacts of climate change.
Background
 The $3.375B DMAF was launched in Spring 2018 and, through multiple intake processes, a total
of 69 projects were approved for a total federal contribution of $1.9B, including more than
$217 million has been invested in 7 disaster mitigation projects such as flood protection across
British Columbia.
 [Redacted]
 INFC officials are closely following the flood situation and recovery efforts in British Columbia.
Under DMAF, the Skwah First Nation and City of Chilliwack Flood Protection Project was
approved in April 2019 with federal funding of $45M. In addition, [redacted] from communities
impacted by the flooding event were submitted through DMAF’s recent project intakes, which
are currently being assessed against the program criteria. It should be noted that these projects
were submitted before the flooding occurred.
 The ICIP provides long-term, stable funding for public infrastructure initiatives in Canada. This
ten-year allocation-based program promotes strong collaboration between all levels of
government by advancing outcomes in a manner that is flexible and responsive to unique local,
provincial and territorial circumstances, and supporting local and regional decision-making in
the realm of public infrastructure.
 Under ICIP, a total of 33 disaster mitigation projects have been approved in British Columbia
representing a total federal contribution of $75M.
 Through Budget 2021, the Government of Canada provided an additional one-time investment
of $2.2 billion to communities, doubling the 2020-21 CCBF allocations. Disaster mitigation
projects are eligible under CCBF.

Support for Transit
Issue
The Permanent Public Transit Program (PPTP) is a transfer payment program that supports economic,
environmental, and social benefits by funding sustainable mobility infrastructure such as public transit
systems, active transportation networks, and other solutions in communities of all sizes across Canada.
Response
 The Government of Canada is fully committed to supporting transit in Canada and is making
investments that support economic, environmental, and social benefits by funding sustainable
mobility infrastructure such as public transit systems, active transportation networks, and other
solutions in communities of all sizes across Canada.
 Budget 2021 provided $14.9 billion over 8 years for the Permanent Public Transit Program
(PPTP) including $3 billion per year ongoing starting in 2026-2027. This funding builds on the
$20 billion in funding already available for transit across the country from existing federal
programs.
 These transit investments will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide health benefits,
and better serve disadvantaged groups including women, seniors, youth and those with low
incomes.
 Federal transit funding supports public transit systems and active transportation networks,
creates jobs, and makes communities more accessible and liveable to all.
 The new PPTP includes three direct application funds:
o The $2.75 billion Zero Emission Transit Fund (ZETF);
o The $400 million Active Transportation Fund (ATF); and
o The $250 million Rural Transit Solutions Fund (RTSF).
 [Redacted]
Background
The Permanent Public Transit Program (PPTP) includes three direct application funds which aim to
support the economic recovery from COVID-19 by creating jobs, particularly in the construction sector
and throughout related supply chains:
 The Zero Emission Transit Fund (ZETF): This five year, $2.75B ZETF will advance the Government
of Canada’s commitment to help procure 5,000 zero emission public transit and school buses
across Canada. Funding would be closely coordinated with the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s
(CIB) $1.5B commitment to invest in Zero Emission Buses (ZEBs) as part of its three-year Growth
Plan.
 The Active Transportation Fund (ATF): This five year, $400M ATF will expand and enhance
active transportation networks in communities of all types and sizes, and support Canada’s first
National Active Transportation Strategy. It would do so by supporting planning for and
deployment of a wide range of walking, cycling, and other active mobility infrastructure. The
Fund will allocate a minimum of 10% of the total funding envelope for Indigenous recipients.
 The Rural Transit Solutions Fund (RTSF): This five year, $250M RTSF would address unique
mobility challenges in rural communities by supporting planning and deployment of locally-
tailored mobility solutions in rural communities, including support to assess the viability of new
approaches to mobility. In support of reconciliation, a minimum of 10% of the funding envelope
for RTSF will be allocated to Indigenous projects being led by and for Indigenous populations
and communities.
[Redacted] Seven projects have been announced and three approved. [Redacted]
They are:
o The $ 4.0 billion Ontario Line Subway;
o The $ 2.3 billion Scarborough Line Extension;
o The $ 1.9 billion Eglinton Crosstown West Extension;
o The $ 2.2 billion Yonge North Subway Extension (announced, not approved);

Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor Project
Issue
Progress of the Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor Project and implications for Supplementary
Estimates B.
Response
 Thanks to significant investments by the Government of Canada, the Samuel De Champlain
Bridge Corridor is open to traffic.
 Outstanding construction work on this signature federal infrastructure project in Montréal is
expected to be completed in 2022.
 The funding requested in Supplementary Estimates B is to move $94.2 million from 2020-21 to
2021-22. The anticipated use for these funds is as follows:
• $13.2 million for operating to meet existing contractual obligations as well as ensure a
contingency is available to address any unforeseen events or changes to the SDCBC
project;
• $81 million for capital reprofiled to 2021-22 from unspent amounts from the Design-
Build period to be used as contingency as required.
 The $94.2 million is part of larger amount of $125.6 million being reprofiled from 2020-21. The
residual is being reprofiled to future years (2022-23 to 2024-25) for the following:
• $16.5 million for operating for unforeseen risks and project contingencies;
• $14.9 million for capital for outstanding work and project contingencies.
 In parallel, major work is underway to build the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) light rail
system in the Samuel De Champlain Bridge corridor to provide new public transit options for the
region by connecting the South Shore to downtown Montréal.
 The deconstruction of the old Champlain Bridge is also underway using innovative techniques
that aim to protect the environment and allow for the reuse of bridge components. The project
is on pace to be completed in 2024.
Background
 The Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor includes the 3.4 km Samuel De Champlain Bridge crossing
the St. Lawrence, 500 m Île-des-Sœurs Bridge, reconstruction and widening of the federal portion of
Highway 15 over 3 km, and realignment of over 1 km of Highway 10.
 The project is being delivered as part of a public-private partnership (P3) between the Government
of Canada and Signature on the Saint-Laurent Group (SSLG). The P3 includes the design,
construction, financing, operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of the Project over a 34-year
period (2015-2049) at a cost of $4.212 billion.
 The Project Agreement is managed through an integrated project team with Infrastructure Canada
as the project lead, Public Works and Procurement Canada as the contracting lead, and Justice
Canada providing legal support.
 The Samuel De Champlain Bridge was open to traffic in 2019. Work is still left to bring the project to
final completion such as landscaping, the correction of non-compliances and other minor
deficiencies.
 Funding has been requested in Supplementary Estimates B to move $94.2 million from 2020-21 to
2021-22. This is part of a larger amount of $125.6 million to be moved from 2020-21 to 2021-22 and
future years as follows:
Total Funding Reprofiled to Reprofiled to
Reprofiled 2021-22
2022-23 to 2024-25
Operating funding reprofiled $29.7 million $13.2 million $16.5 million
Capital funding reprofiled $95.9 million $81.0 million $14.9 million
Total funding reprofiled $125.6 million $94.2 million $31.4 million
 Outstanding obligations relate to ongoing capital payments as well as payments for operations,
maintenance and rehabilitation that will continue for the next 28 years.
 Contingency funds are required for ongoing operational requirements that fluctuate over time
including the volume of heavy trucks, insurance expenses, and other unexpected events that have
had an impact on the overall operating costs.
 Ongoing capital requirements for the Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor are for outstanding
construction issues, contingency funding should there be events such as discovery of unknown
contaminated soil or for changes that may be required to the configuration of the corridor that are
not within the Private Partner’s contractual obligations.
 The Samuel De Champlain Bridge includes a central corridor dedicated exclusively to public transit,
in which the Réseau express métropolitain (REM) light rail transit system is being built. The segment
of the REM between the South Shore to downtown Montréal that crosses the Samuel De Champlain
Bridge is expected to be operational in 2022.
 The project to deconstruct the original Champlain Bridge is managed by Jacques Cartier and
Champlain Bridges Incorporated (JCCBI). The overall estimated cost of the deconstruction project,
including the deconstruction work, environmental protection measures, material reuse programs,
research and development and the end-of-project shoreline redevelopment component is
approximately $400 million. This amount includes $225.7 million for the design-deconstruct contract
signed by JCCBI and Nouvel Horizon
St-Laurent G.P. Deconstruction work began in August 2020.
 A lawsuit has been filed by the private partner, Signature on the St. Lawrence Group (SSL) with the
Superior Court of Quebec, which is not uncommon in large-scale infrastructure projects such as this
one. The action relates to the delayed completion date for the opening of the Samuel De Champlain

Issue
What are the key results to date for the Investing in Canada Plan?
Response
 The Investing in Canada Plan is generating economic growth, creating good jobs, and building
strong, green, inclusive communities for Canadians to live and work in.
o Under the Plan, we have invested in over 7,000 green and reduced-emissions buses,
created over 40,400 affordable childcare spaces, and improved internet connectivity for
over 164,000 households in rural and remote communities.
 We have approved thousands of projects across the country, improving Canadians’ access to
affordable housing, clean water, highways, community centres, and transit systems.
 Auditor General of Canada Report: The Auditor General found that Infrastructure Canada was
able to provide a full accounting of the $188-billion Investing in Canada Plan. The Government
has accepted the Auditor General’s recommendation to improve reporting and are taking steps
to respond to the findings in the report.
 Parliamentary Budget Officer: We have responded to all requests from the Parliamentary
Budget Officer and have provided all requested information to support his work.
 COVID-19: In response to COVID-19, the Government of Canada has adapted programming
under the Plan to give communities more flexibility to access funds.
Background
 The Investing in Canada Plan (the Plan) is the federal government's long-term infrastructure
plan that was announced in Budgets 2016 and 2017. The Plan is a point-in-time snapshot of
government-wide investments in infrastructure, and does not include newer infrastructure
investments announced in Budgets 2018, 2019 and 2021.
 The Plan provides a strategic framework to guide the delivery of over $180 billion in federal
investments in infrastructure over 12 years and is focused on achieving three key objectives:
generating long-term economic growth to build a stronger middle class; improving the
resiliency of communities and Canada’s transition to a clean growth economy; and
enhancing social inclusion and socio-economic outcomes for all Canadians.
 Infrastructure Canada is responsible for the overall coordination and annual reporting on
results for the 93 programs under the Plan. The department delivers Investing in Canada
programming along with 21 other federal departments and agencies.
 As of November 2021, over $100 billion has been allocated to more than 74,000 projects
and $61 billion has been paid out.
 Auditor General of Canada: The Auditor General of Canada tabled a report on the Plan in
March 2021, which recommended that Infrastructure Canada improve monitoring, tracking,
and reporting on progress toward the Investing in Canada Plan’s objectives. The
Government accepted the Auditor General’s recommendation and is working to review
performance indicators, integrate legacy programs into the Plan’s reporting structure, and
improve reporting to ensure consistency and ease of comprehension.
 Parliamentary Budget Officer: Over the course of five reports written between March 2018
and June 2020, the Parliamentary Budget Officer has raised various issues about the Plan,
notably that the pace in infrastructure spending under the Plan is slower then expected due
to implementation delays by provincial and municipal governments; that the economic and
job creation impacts of the Plan have been lower than anticipated as a result of delays in
federal spending; and that higher federal spending has not led to increases in provincial
spending that would be expected. The PBO has found, however, that municipal spending
has increased in response to the introduction on the Investing in Canada Plan. In testimony
before Parliamentary committees, the PBO has indicated that he has not been provided
with information about all projects funded under the Plan. These issues have been resolved.
 COVID-19: In response to COVID-19, a new temporary COVID-19 Resilience stream was
created in the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, with over $3 billion available in
existing funding, to provide provinces and territories with added flexibility to fund quick-
start, short-term projects that might not otherwise be eligible under existing funding
streams. The COVID-19 Resilience stream also took action to help communities address
COVID-19 specific challenges by providing a larger federal cost share for eligible projects to
alleviate financial pressures communities faced from the start of the pandemic.
Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program
Issue
Infrastructure Canada has signed long-term infrastructure agreements with all provincial and territorial
partners to make unprecedented investments in public transit, green infrastructure, recreational,
cultural, and community infrastructure, as well as rural and northern communities.
Response
 Under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program Bilateral Agreements, Infrastructure
Canada is providing $33.5 billion in funding for public transit, green, community, culture and
recreational, and rural and northern infrastructure projects from coast to coast to coast.
 Three years in, over $20 billion for over 4,500 projects has already been approved, and an
additional $1.3 billion is currently under review.
 To address the challenges faced by communities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program now includes a new COVID-19 Resiliency
Infrastructure stream and expanded eligibilities under the program’s previous streams to deliver
more infrastructure projects during the pandemic.
 Communities across the country are also benefiting from an additional investment of
$120 million through the COVID-19 Resiliency Infrastructure stream for ventilation improvement
projects to make indoor public spaces safer by reducing the risk of disease transmission.
 Once projects are approved, our partners can start their projects immediately.
Background
The Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP) is the centrepiece of Infrastructure Canada’s
funding initiatives supporting the broader Investing in Canada Plan.
This 10 year allocation-based program promotes strong collaboration between all levels of government
by advancing outcomes in a manner that is flexible and responsive to unique local, provincial and
territorial circumstances, and supporting local and regional decision-making in the realm of public
infrastructure.
Provinces and territories (P/Ts), in consultation with municipalities and Indigenous communities, are
responsible for identifying, prioritizing and submitting projects and flowing funds to eligible ultimate
recipients.
Managed through Integrated Bilateral Agreements (IBAs), the ICIP was originally divided into four
funding streams: Public Transit ($20.1 billion); Green Infrastructure ($9.2 billion); Community, Culture
and Recreation Infrastructure ($1.3 billion); and Rural and Northern Infrastructure ($2 billion +
$400 million).
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the new COVID-19 Resilience stream will help communities
respond to the immediate pressures and concerns as a result of the current pandemic as well as build
resiliency for the future. The new time-limited stream will have an increased federal cost-share for a
broadened range of infrastructure projects and a simplified approval process to allow work to get
underway quickly while respecting public health measures. In 2021, $120 million was added to the
COVID-19 Resilience stream to fund ventilation improvement projects in public buildings to increase air
quality and circulation and reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Examples of eligible projects include:
Transit: New Light Rail Transit systems; extensions of existing subway systems; electric bus purchases; or
removing barriers in the built environment, such as by providing wheelchair ramps at transit stations.
Green: Renewable energy storage; strategic Interties; publicly-accessible electric vehicle (EV) charging
stations; preservation of natural wetland systems, rehabilitation of public infrastructure to be climate
resilient; or, water main and sewer replacement, waste diversion, and recycling facilities.
Community, Culture and Recreation: Community centres, art galleries, community recreation and trail
facilities, and community service hubs.
Rural and Northern: Greenhouses, community freezers, short sea shipping wharves, and broadband
projects.
COVID-19 stream: Upgrades to municipal buildings, hospitals or schools, temporary COVID-19 testing
facilities, and active transportation pathways.
2021-22 Supplementary Estimates (B)
Issue
What Infrastructure Canada (INFC) is seeking in Supplementary Estimates (B).
Response
 INFC is seeking an increase of $94.3M in the 2021-22 Supplementary Estimates (B) for the
Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor (SDCBC) project. While the Corridor is fully operational,
this funding is required to complete the project by late 2022.
 The Champlain Bridge Corridor project was originally approved in 2014 with an investment of
$3.977 billion. The bridge was opened to traffic in 2019 and Infrastructure Canada has paid
$2.2 billion to date.
 Unused funds from 2020-21 were made available in 2021-22 and are being accessed through
these Supplementary Estimates in an effort for INFC to meet existing contractual obligations as
well as ensure a contingency is available to address any unforeseen events or changes to the
SDCBC project.
Background
 The Samuel De Champlain Bridge Corridor includes the 3.4 km Samuel De Champlain Bridge crossing
the St. Lawrence, 500 m Île-des-Sœurs Bridge, reconstruction and widening of the federal portion of
Highway 15 over 3 km, and realignment of over 1 km of Highway 10.
 The project is being delivered as part of a public-private partnership (P3) between the Government
of Canada and Signature on the Saint-Laurent Group (SSLG). The P3 includes the design,
construction, financing, operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of the Project over a 34-year
period (2015-2049) at a cost of $4.212 billion.
 The Samuel De Champlain Bridge was open to traffic in 2019 and the final of three major
construction milestone payments was made in 2019-20.
 Outstanding obligations relate to ongoing capital payments as well as payments for operations,
maintenance and rehabilitation that will continue for the next 28 years.
 Contingency funds are required for ongoing operational requirements that fluctuate over time
including the volume of heavy trucks, insurance expenses, and other unexpected events that have
had an impact on the overall operating costs that are not within the Private Partners contractual
obligations.
 Ongoing capital requirements for the SDCBC are for outstanding construction issues, contingency
funding should there be supervening events such as discovery of contaminated soil, or for changes
that may be required to the configuration of the corridor that that are not within the Private
Partners contractual obligations.
 Work is still left to bring the SDCBC project to final completion such as landscaping, the correction of
deficiencies with noise barriers and other minor deficiencies.
