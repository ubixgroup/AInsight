On this page Overview Process to prioritize outdoor air pollutants Contact us Overview Under the Air Quality Management System, the federal, provincial and territorial governments work together to revise and update the Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS). There are CAAQS for 4 major outdoor air pollutants: ozone (O3) sulphur dioxide (SO2) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) fine particulate matter (PM2.5) CAAQS have been developed to protect human health and the environment. In addition to CAAQS, Health Canada is developing health-based air quality objectives (HBAQOs) as there are other pollutants in outdoor air that can be harmful to human health. HBAQOs: consider health risks only can be implemented based on context and need are voluntary for stakeholders, including provinces and territories are for short-term and long-term exposures to outdoor air pollutants represent the highest safe exposure levels for outdoor air pollutants will support all levels of governments and other partners in managing air quality Health Canada uses HBAQOs to assess health risks. In comparison, the CAAQS represent government commitments to continuously improve air quality across the country, based on health effects, environmental effects, feasibility and achievability. We will conduct public consultations on the HBAQOs before we finalize and publish them. Process to prioritize outdoor air pollutants Health Canada consulted federal, provincial, territorial, municipal and other air partners to identify priority pollutants for the development of HBAQOs. This process had 3 steps: Developing the inventory of pollutants considered to be candidates for HBAQO development Health Canada created a list of candidate air pollutants by compiling: air pollutants identified internationally as potential priorities pollutants commonly released to or measured in outdoor air in Canada Prioritizing based on health risk Health Canada scored and ranked candidate air pollutants according to: concerns for human health the potential for exposure in outdoor air in Canada Selecting final candidatesFollowing consultation with federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments and other air partners, Health Canada selected a group of priority candidate pollutants for HBAQO development. These air pollutants are: arsenic benzene formaldehyde carbon monoxide PM10, that is, particles with a diameter of 10 microns and smaller Contact us If you would like more information on Health Canada's process to prioritize outdoor air pollutants for HBAQO development, please contact us at: Email: air@hc-sc.gc.ca Telephone: 1-833-223-1014 (toll free) Subscribe to the air quality email subscription list Page details Date modified: 2022-10-27 About this site Health Canada Contact us Government of Canada All contacts Departments and agencies About government Themes and topics Jobs Immigration and citizenship Travel and tourism Business Benefits Health Taxes Environment and natural resources National security and defence Culture, history and sport Policing, justice and emergencies Transport and infrastructure Canada and the world Money and finances Science and innovation Indigenous Peoples Veterans and military Youth Government of Canada Corporate Social media Mobile applications About Canada.ca Terms and conditions Privacy
