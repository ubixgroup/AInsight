The purpose of this Cyclical Enforcement (CE) project was to verify industry’s compliance of mattresses and futons with the requirements of the Mattresses Regulations. For this project, compliance of select mattresses and futons with the Mattresses Regulations was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors visited establishments and sampled relevant products. Compliance with the requirements listed under the Regulations was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating this CE project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of mattress and futon companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2017-2018 fiscal year, flammability testing of 9 different products was carried out. All products were compliant and no corrective actions were required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
