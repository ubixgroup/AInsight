Introduction
Mr. Speaker, Honourable members,
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today. I am pleased to share our
resourcing plans with you, as the Government of Canada continues to address the mental health
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
I also want to acknowledge the exceptional, ongoing work of this Committee to ensure the health and
safety of people in Canada, as we work together to fight COVID-19.
Impact of COVID-19 on mental health
As we all know, the past two years have been extremely difficult for most people in Canada.
COVID-19—and the protective public health measures associated with it—continue to affect the
mental health of individuals and families across the country.
It will come as no surprise that many people are reporting an increase in stress, anxiety, depression and
loneliness.
Overdose crisis
The pandemic has also worsened long-standing challenges related to substance use, including the
ongoing opioid overdose crisis. Tragically, the latest national data confirms that 2020 was the worst year
on record for overdose deaths and harms in Canada. This trend continued in 2021, with many
jurisdictions reporting record-breaking overdose deaths.
The message is clear: We must do more.
Role as Minister of Mental Health and Addictions
As the Government of Canada’s first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, I have been tasked with
ensuring that mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of our universal health care system. I
will be working collaboratively with partners, including provinces and territories, to develop and
implement a comprehensive, evidence-based mental health plan. My mandate also includes leading a
whole-of society approach to address substance use.
This work is already well underway.
Early in the pandemic, we launched an online portal for mental health and substance use support. The
Wellness Together Canada portal provides free, 24/7 services and resources to people in need across
Canada, including one-on-one counselling. Last January, we improved digital access to this platform with
a companion app called PocketWell.
This is important ─ because everyone in Canada should have access to the mental health and substance
use services they need, no matter where they live.
With this in mind, Budget 2021 provided $45 million to help develop national standards to address the
needs of people in Canada related to mental health and substance use.
On March 14 (TBC), I was proud to announce that this process is now underway. The Government of
Canada is working with the Standards Councilof Canada, with partners, to develop standards that will
help guide how mental health and substance use services are delivered in Canada. The goal is to ensure
that everyone has access to high-quality, safe and equitable services.
Supplementary Estimates(C) 2021-2022 and Main Estimates 2022-2023
The Health portfolio is focused on supporting these services and addressing the opioid overdose crisis.
As you know, we tabled our Supplementary Estimates (C) last month, which amended our budget to
better supportevolving priorities to the end of fiscal year 2021-2022. I am happy to answer any
questions you may have about these.
Today, I would also like to share how our Main Estimates for 2022-2023 will support our ongoing work
to address mental health and substance use in Canada..
Specifically, the Public Health Agency of Canada is requesting $82.4 million to support the mental health
of those most affected by COVID-19.
Health Canada is seeking $14.3 million for the Mental Health Commission of Canada.
The Government of Canada also remains committed to addressing substance use in Canada. As such,
Health Canada is seeking $65.1 million for its work to address the opioid overdose crisis.
Finally, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research is requesting $2.25 millionfor two catalyst grant
funding opportunities to support the development of national mental health and substance use
standards.
Conclusion
Mr. Speaker, as we begin to move beyond the crisis phase of COVID-19 toward a more sustainable
model, we must continue to address the ongoing health care challenges that have been exposed by the
pandemic.
Mental health and substance use are two such challenges. Now is the time to invest in long-term
solutions that will allow us to emerge from the pandemic stronger, healthier and more resilient for years
to come. Thank you.
OPIOID OVERDOSE CRISIS (86 words)
• Our Government recognizes that theoverdose crisis is one of the most serious and
unprecedented public health threats in Canada’s history.
• We continue to support efforts to improve access to treatment and harm reduction services,
strengthen enforcement to reduce the toxic illegal drug supply, increase awareness and prevention, and
investin research and surveillance.

Indigenous communities and people with lived and living experience, to save lives and reverse this
national public health crisis.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEW NUMBERS DISCLOSED IN THE OPIOID REPORT (84 words)
• Our Government remains deeply concerned over the tragic loss of so many lives to the overdose
crisis. The lack of availabletreatment, safer supply, and other services remain challenging.
• That is why our Government remains committed to addressing the overdose crisis through a
comprehensive approach, including naloxone access and training, supervised consumption sites and
safer supply programs. Without these, the number of deathswould be exponentially worse.
• Our Government remains committed to working with all our partners to end this complex public
health crisis.
IFPRESSED ON TREATMENT (85 words)
• Our Government recognizes that improved access to treatment services can help those
struggling with substance use and save lives.
• We have approved the use of new medications for treatment, removed barriers to prescribing
and dispensing, and supported the development of clinical guidelines for injectable opioid agonist
treatment.
• Our Government has provided $150 million through the Emergency Treatment Fund for
provinces and territories to improve access to evidence-based treatment services, which, when cost-
matched by provinces and territories, will result in an investment of over $300 million.
IF PRESSED ON HARM REDUCTION (107 words)
• The evidence is clear–harm reduction measures save lives.
• The Government has committed funding to innovative projects, such asproviding medication as
an alternative tothe toxic illegal drug supply.

consumption sites have reversed nearly 35,000 overdoses without a single death at a site.
• OurGovernment has also increased access to life-saving naloxone across the country, including
to remote and isolated First Nations and Inuit communities.
• We have also proactively provided the authority for provinces and territories to establish
temporaryurgent public health need sites, otherwise known as overdose prevention sites, to address
rising number of overdoses.
IF PRESSED ON AWARENESS AND PREVENTION (85 words)
• Our Government recognizes the importance of investing in prevention and awareness.
• We have invested in prevention campaignsthat include engaging youth andyoung adults on
risks and harms of substance use and the impact of stigma on people who use drugs.
• We supported school-based approaches that enhance student well-being in order toprevent
substance use related harmsfor this important population.
• We are also funding projects that promote changes in the health system to help enhance the
pathways to care for people who use drugs.
IF PRESSED ON SAFER SUPPLY (79 words)
• Our Government is aware that the pandemic has led to an increasingly dangerous and
unpredictable illegal drug supply.
• We have taken action to save lives by providing funding through the Substance Use and
Addictions Program to support projects that provide people who use drugs with safer, pharmaceutical-
grade alternatives tothe toxic illegal drug supply.
• We have also allowed pharmacists to extend, renew and transfer prescriptions to support better
access to medications, including for the treatment of substance use disorders.
IF PRESSED ON SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION SITES (83 words)
• Evidence shows that supervised consumption sites reduce harms and save lives.
• Since 2017, supervised consumption sites in Canada have received more than 3.3 million visits,
reversed almost 35,000 overdoses without a single death at a site, and made over 148,000 referralsto
health and social services.
• These sites also provide access to other health and social services, including opportunities to
access treatment.
• We will continue towork with provinces, territories, and stakeholders so that Canadians
continue to have access to these lifesaving services.
IF PRESSED ON MOMS STOP THE HARM (MSTH) LITIGATION REGARDING ALBERTA’S RECOVERY
ORIENTED OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES GUIDE (NEW MEASURES FOR SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION
SITES) (82 words)
• The Government of Canada is committed to a comprehensive public health approach to the
overdose crisis that includes evidence-based harm reduction activities, such as supervised consumption
sites and services.
• The evidence is clear-supervised consumption sites reduce harms and save lives. I intend to
continue to engage and work with provinces and territories, as well as municipalities, to enable access
to evidence based services.
• We will continueto follow the litigation closely and consider its impact on federal policy and
legislation.
IF PRESSED ON THE EXPERT TASK FORCE ON SUBSTANCE USE (60 words)
• We are committed to a comprehensive public health approach to substance use that is focused
onreducing harms, saving lives, and gettingpeople the supports they need.
• We are studying the Expert Task Force on Substance Use recommendations on how we can
better treat substance use as a health issue. These recommendations are publicly available on the
Health Canada website.
IF PRESSED ON PAIN (85 words)
• In May 2021, the Canadian Pain Task Force published their final report with recommendations
to ensure people with pain are recognized and supported, and that pain is understood, prevented, and
effectively treated.
• We have invested over $175M in research through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research
and close to $19M in funding for 12 initiatives through the Substance Use and Addictions Program
(SUAP) focused on improving opioid prescribingpractices and pain management.
• We will continue to work with our partners to explore implementing the recommendations.
IF PRESSED ON DIACETYLMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDE (DAM) (95 words)
• Our Government is committed to a comprehensive public health approach to support people
who are living with an addiction.
• On February 16, 2022, Health Canada authorized Diacetylmorphine Hydrochloride (DAM) as a
supervised injectable opioid agonist treatment.
• Diacetylmorphine has already been approved in a number of European countries. Evidence
shows that it can help stabilize and improve the health of some people who are living with an addiction,
including increasing their retention in treatment programs.
• As with all authorized drugs, Health Canada will monitor its safety and effectiveness and will
take prompt action should concerns arise.
IF PRESSED ON SUAP FUNDING (99 words)
• Through Budget 2021, $116M over two years (2021/2022 and 2022/2023) was provided to SUAP
to support a range of innovative approaches to prevention,harm reduction, and treatment.
• In response, the department launched a national call for proposals and a directed call seeking
new efforts to reduce, prevent, and address the harms associated with substance use–which have
grown more serious duringthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
• Hundreds of SUAP proposals were received and Health Canada has consulted with numerous
experts, and with Provincial officials, to determine where new investments should be made. Applicants
will be notified of funding decisions imminently.
BACKGROUND
Most recent national data indicates that 24,626 apparent opioid toxicity deaths occurred between
January 2016 and June 2021. Fentanyl and its analogues continue to be major drivers of the crisis with
as many as 87% of accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2021 (January to June) involving
fentanyl. While Canadians of all walks of life are affected, there are striking patterns, with death most
common among males and individuals aged 20 to 49 years old.
The COVID-19pandemic is compounding the ongoing overdose crisis, and people who use drugs are
experiencing higher risks related to an increasingly toxic illegal drug supply and reduced access to
treatment and harm reduction services. Several jurisdictions have observed unprecedented numbers
and rates in relation to the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although these increases have been observed across the country, Western Canada continues to be
highly impacted. In 2020, the British Columbia Coroners Service reported 1,724 illegal drug toxicity
deaths, a 75% increase over the number of deaths in 2019. Additionally, the crisis in BC continued into
2021 with 1,782 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths from January to October, a 24% increase over the
same in the previous year (1,438 deaths) and a 112% increase from the same period of time in 2019
(January to October 2019–840 deaths).
Tragically, overdose deaths among First Nations people in BC have also surged, increasing by 119% in
2020 compared to 2019. Data released by Alberta in December 2021 indicated that from January to
October 2021 the province reported 1,372 deaths from all substances, the highest number per year
since the province began tracking such deaths in 2016. Of these deaths, 1,247 were related to opioids.
The highest opioid-related death count was in Edmonton (473) followed by Calgary (390).
FEDERAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESSTHE OVERDOSE CRISIS
Since 2017, the federal government has taken significant actions and made investments of over $700M
to address the overdose crisis and substance use-related harms. Additional actions to date include:
improved access to treatment and harm reduction, reduced regulatory barriers to treatment;
strengthened law enforcement, developed of educational products and tools for the public and health
care providers, and research and surveillance to build the evidence base.
This includes Budget 2019investments of $106.7M over five years with $1M ongoing and $66M
announced in the Fall Economic Statement to help support community-based organizations responding
to substance use issues address the additional challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March
2021, the government announced $20 million in funding for the distribution of naloxone kits and opioid
overdose response training to support communities that have been particularly affected by the opioid
overdose crisis and are experiencing challenges in improving health outcomes of their residents. Budget
2021 also committed an additional $116 million to fund projects through the Substance Use and
Addictions Program (SUAP).
In addition to these investments, the Government of Canada has also takenaction to make it easier for
people being treated for substance use disorder to access medications and for frontline service
providers to establish overdose prevention sites in temporary shelters.
The Minister of Health established an Expert Task Force on Substance Use in March 2021 that provided
expert advice on Canada’s federal drug policy, including examining potential alternatives to criminal
penalties for personal drug possession. The Task Force provided its final advice on alternatives to
criminal penalties in May 2021, and on federal drug policy in June 2021. Both reports of the Task Force
have been made publicly available and can be found online at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-
canada/corporate/about-health-canada/public-engagement/external-advisory-bodies/expert-task-
force-substance-use/reports.html.
CHALLENGE TO THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA’S RECOVERY ORIENTED OVERDOSE PREVENTION SERVICES
GUIDE
On August 13, 2021, Moms Stop the Harm Society (MSTH) and Lethbridge Overdose Prevention Society
(LOPS) commenced a legal action in the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta against Her Majesty the
Queen in Right of Alberta seeking an Order declaring the provincial Recovery Oriented Overdose
Prevention Services Guide to be constitutionally invalid and inoperable,and of no force and effect on
the basis that it is outside of provincial jurisdiction, and violates Charter rights. Alberta’s Recovery
Oriented Overdose Prevention Services Guide imposes new measures on supervised consumption
services in Alberta, including the creation of a licencing regime for these services and includes an
obligation that supervised consumption service providers ask for a client’s personal health number at
initial intake.
DIACETYLMORPHINE HYDROCHLORIDE DRUG AUTHORIZATION
On February 16,2022, Health Canada authorized Diacetylmorphine Hydrochloride (DAM) as a
supervised injectable opioid agonist treatment (siOAT) for adult patients with severe opioid use disorder
(OUD) who use injectable opioids and have been unsuccessful with previous attempts at opioid agonist
therapy, includingmethadone maintenance therapy.
DAM is available only by prescription. Health care professionals who meet the definition of ‘practitioner’
under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act can prescribe controlled substances. Prescribing ability is
further controlled by provincial/territorial scope of practice and any regulatory college requirements for
the prescribing of DAM.
As with any other form of care, a practitioner's decision to prescribe medications for safersupply
depends on:
• their professional judgement
• the unique needs of each patient
• the rules and regulations in their province or territory
Diacetylmorphine has been approved as a treatment option for severe OUD in a number of countries,
including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Prior to this
authorization, internationally-produced DAM was only available on an emergency basis through the List
of Drugs foran Urgent Public Health Need.
At this time, only one company has applied for the authorization of DAM in Canada. Should additional
companies wish to apply for authorization, Health Canada would review their submissions. The company
receiving the authorization, Pharmascience Inc., expects to initially provide DAM supply only for the
province of British Columbia.
The new authorized indication for DAM is as an evidence-based treatment option for severe OUD; this
Health Canada authorization adds a new tool for practitioners to care and prevent harms for people
withsevere opioid disorder, including overdose.

Other transfer payments
- Payments to provinces and territories for the Purpose of Home Care and Mental Health
o Purpose/objectives
 The Government of Canada is investing $11 billion over ten years (from 2017 to
2027) tosupport the provinces and territories in improving access to home and
community care ($6 billion) and mental health and addictions ($5 billion)
services in their jurisdictions, in accordance with the Common Statement of
Principles for Shared Health Priorities which was jointly agreed to by federal,
provincial and territorial (FPT) Ministers of Health (with the exception of
Quebec) in August 2017.
 Governments agreed to common objectives in each of home and community
care and mental health and addiction services, and in particular to improving
access to mental health and addictions through one or more of the following
areas of action:
 Expanding access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth (age 10-25), recognizing the
effectiveness of early interventions to treat mild to moderate mental
health disorders;
 Spreading evidence-based models of community mental health care and
culturally-appropriate interventions that are integrated with primary
health services; and,
 Expandingavailability of integrated community-based mental health
and addiction services for people with complex health needs.
 Similarly, on home and community care, FPT governments agreed to work
together to improve access to services through one or more of the following
areas of action:
 Spreading and scaling evidence-based models of home and community
care that are more integrated and connected to primary health care;
 Enhancing access to palliative and end-of-life care at home or in
hospices;
 Increasing support for caregivers; and,
 Enhancing home care infrastructure, such as digital connectivity,
remote monitoring technology and facilities for community based
service delivery.
 Governments also agreed to develop a focused set of common indicators to
measure progress on these priority areas. The Canadian Institute for Health
Information (CIHI) led a collaborative process which culminated in May 2018
when federal, provincial and territorial Ministers of Health endorsed a suite of
12 common indicators to be implementedover the coming years. CIHI will
continue to work with governments across Canada to report annually on these
indicators.
 Following agreement on the Common Statement of Principles for Shared Health
Priorities in 2017, the federal government negotiated andsigned the first of two
sequential bilateral agreements with all 13 provinces and territories which set
out details of how each jurisdiction is using federal investments to improve
access to home and community care and mental health and addiction services.
The bilateral agreements with the provinces and territories will be renewed
starting in 2021-22 for the remaining five years of the ten-year commitment.
o Expected results
 It is expected that through these investments Canadians will experience tangible
improvements in access to home and community care as well as mental health
and addictions services. This will lead to better health outcomes and a more
sustainable health care system, as care is shifted from expensive hospital care to
more patient-centric settings in the home and in the community. These
investments could also have a broader, positive impact on Canada's economy,
by making the health care system more sustainable in the long term, and by
enhancing workforce productivity and social participation.

Health Canada
- Funding for the procurement of additional rapid test kits (COVID-19)
o Total: $3,200,000,000
o Taskforce
o Key messages
 The Government has played a leadership role throughout the pandemic
including procuring and distributing COVID-19 rapid teststo ensure equitable
access for all Canadian residents.
 COVID-19 rapid tests will remain a critical tool to minimize community
transmission as Canada reduces restrictive public health measures and opens up
the economy.
 With the global shortage of these tests, ongoing federal procurement is
required to ensure test access for smaller jurisdictions with less buying power.
o Purpose/objectives
 This additional funding provided the financial means by which the Government
was able to continue to procure COVID-19 rapid tests at the onset of the
Omicron variant and the means to ensure equitable access to tests across all
jurisdictions in the coming months.
 The ongoing federal procurement role will also provide critical support to
workplaces and non-profit sectors by continuing to make available tests through
the workplace direct delivery program, for small and medium enterprises,
through local pharmacies, and non-profit sector and vulnerable populations
through the Canadian Red Cross.
o Expected results
 All jurisdictions will have a stable supply of COVID-19 rapid tests distributed on a
per capita basis over the coming months.
 In support of the roll-out of the anti-viral PAXLOVID, clinicians will have access
to point of care COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests to ensure the early confirmation
needed for optimal therapeutic benefit of the treatment.
 Northern/Remote/Isolated communities have the testing capacity needed to

o Taskforce
o Key messages
 The COVID-19 pandemic has been unpredictable, as highlighted late last
summer when many jurisdictions started to think about winding down testing
and then had to pivot in responseto Delta and Omicron variant
 Furthermore, in the past number of days, many provinces and territories (PTs)
announced significant changes in their public health measures, with many PTs
removing most or all measures.
 Funding to support emergency measures given the uncertainty of the pandemic
and the unknown impact of shifts in public health measures.
o Purpose/objectives
 This Contingency will provide the funding for Health Canada to respond to
unexpected shifts in the pandemic including, but not limited to, enhanced point
of care diagnostic testing, as PTs shift lab-based testing capacity away from PCR
testing to other critical medical testing, expanded testing in
northern/remote/isolated communities.
 This funding will also provide the monies to offset unexpected expenses
associated with the distribution of tests. The recent geo-political landscape
globally resulted in exponential increases in international and domestic logistics
demand.
o Expected results
 Health Canada will have the capacity to continue tosupport PTs, workplaces
and non-profit entities in response to possible future surges/waves in the
pandemic.
 In the event of future waves and/or more localized outbreaks, Canadians have
equitable access to COVID-19 tests.

 The Government is committed to protecting human health and the environment
from the risks posed by pesticides. Pesticides are only registered in Canada after
being thoroughly assessed to ensure no harm to human health or the
environment will result from their use.
 Consistent with the Government’s announcement on August 4, 2021, this
investment in Health Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency will
strengthen pesticide oversight and protection, including improving the
availability of independent data supporting pesticide review decisions, and the
transparency of regulatory decision-making.
o Purpose/objective
 Funds will support the transition to a better informed, more transparent,
accessible and more responsive pesticide regulatory system. This will be
achieved through a number of proposed measures intended to: increase
independentdata generation, including water quality monitoring and pesticide
use data; the creation of an external science advisory committee process to
provide advice prior to pesticide regulatory decisions, including maximum
residue limits; and the establishment ofmodernized business processes to
implement a continuous and risk-based oversight approach
 Several measures will also help increase public confidence and engagement in
the pesticide regulatory process, including plain language communication of the
resultsof PMRA decisions, and improvements to public accessibility of test data
supporting pesticide regulatory decisions.
o Expected results
 Activities under this initiative align with key Pesticide Program performance
outcomes: that pesticides meet current scientific standards with respect to
health and the environment; that Canadians have confidence in the pesticide
regulatory system; and that the health of Canadians and the environment are
protected from risks associated with the use of pesticides.
 Establishingthe external scientific committee process and increasing the
availability of independent data will strengthen evidence-based pesticide
regulatory decision-making.
 To support implementation of the proposed measures, the Government will
also be conducting broad consultations as part of a targeted review of Pest
Control Products Act (2002) in Winter/early Spring 2022. The review will focus
on specific provisions that support improved transparency, increased use of
real-world data and independent advice, and modernized pesticide business
processes.

o Taskforce
o Key messages
 Since the onset of the pandemic PHAC has procured and distributed COVID-19
rapid tests to support current and expected PT needs. In spring 2021, PHAC’s
request to re-profile $444.0M from the Safe Restart Agreement (SRA) was
approved. These funds were depleted by late October 2021.
 Given the magnitude of the pandemic and the important role of screening in
breaking paths of transmission, continued procurement of rapid tests by the
GoC is necessary to support federal, provincial and territorial efforts.
 In November 2021, the Minister of Health sought and had approved the
repurposing and the transfer from the Critical Drug Reserve ($245.0M) and 2020
Fall Economic Statement (FES) ($22.5M) to Public Health Agency of Canada
(PHAC) to fund the ongoing procurement and distribution of COVID-19 rapid
tests.
o Purpose/objective
 Following consultations with PTs in 2021, the design and the scope of the CDR
was revised to include up to a six month supply against projected demand from
PTs and pressures expected on federal direct distribution channels. This change,
coupled with final drug prices that were significantly lower than expected,
greatly reduced the overall anticipated costs of the CDR.
 Given the above, and upon review of its financial forecast, Health Canada
determined that it could repurpose $245.0M in funding from the CDR.
 In addition, upon re-profile approval, $22.5M of the FES investment will be
repurposed and transferred to PHAC. This investment was intended to support
strategic ramping-up of testing and screening. Health Canada has already
established critical partnerships with the Canadian Chambers of Commerce and
Canadian Red Cross, whom are supporting workplace screening by deploying
tests on behalf of PTs, including distributing tests to child-care centres and
privately operated K-12 schools.
o Expected results
 By providing ongoing leadership and support through federal procurement of
COVID-19 tests, the Government of Canada is ensuring a consistent supply of
teststo provinces and territories, and workplaces.
 Federal procurement provides a level playing field from the equity perspective
and ensures that Canadian residents across all jurisdictions have access to care,
not just those living in provinces that have thebuying power to compete in the
competitive global market.

o Expected results
 The Government of Canada will procure safe and effective COVID-19 treatments
for the equitable distribution to provinces and territories, as soon as they
become available and in need by provinces and territories (PTs).
 Currently all existing COVID-19 treatments require an intravenous infusion or
injection at hospitals or health care clinics. The availability of new antiviral
COVID-19 therapies will make outpatient treatment much easier and are
expected to be in high demand by healthcare practitioners and their patients.

seeking $31.77 million to cover expenses on the Canadian COVID-19 Proof of
Vaccination Credential (PVC) project to date and to cover the costs of sustaining
that project through the end of fiscal year 2021-22.
 PHAC is seeking $8.82 million to cover actual and expected costs during this
fiscal year for developing the Canadian PVC technical solution, oversight,
governance, communications and engagement.
o Purpose/objectives
 Through spring and early summer of 2021, the pace and relative level of take-up
of vaccinations in Canada, coupled with an evolving international context for
pandemic mitigation measures made it clear that a verifiable and interoperable
proof of COVID-19 vaccination would be expected as a way to help those
vaccinated in Canada to prove their vaccination history as they travelled
internationally.
 PVCs also provide an important tool to support broader vaccination mandates
which can mitigate the spread of a pandemic, as well as to support economic
reopening following pandemic-related closures of non-essential businesses and
services.
o Expected results
 The federal government’s role has been to negotiate consensus with provinces
and territories to work towards acommon, standardized PVC. The federal
government supported provinces and territories in the issuance of the
standardized Canadian COVID-19 PVC, and is advocating for mutual acceptance
and verification of these proof of vaccination documents for international travel
purposes.
 The standardized, provincial/territorial-issued Canadian PVC is able to support a
safe reopening of the economy by providing those eligible with a secure way of
proving one’s vaccination status.
 This project has also established a potential model for increased provincial and
territorial collaboration

o Total Supplementary Estimates (C): $ 687,230,056
o Key messages
 Early evidence suggests Canada may require a regular supply of vaccine through
2024 to provide boosters and/or second generation vaccines against new
variants of concern. COVID-19 vaccines will also be required for unvaccinated
cohorts such as newly arrived immigrants and visiting workers, and children
under the age of 12, pending product authorization.
 To meet future needs for boosters and unvaccinated cohorts, Canada entered
an advanced purchase agreement with Pfizer in April 2021 for the supply of 35
million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in 2022 and 30 million doses in 2023
 When the agreement was signed, the detailed delivery schedule was unknown
and funding was allocated by fiscal year (i.e. FY2022-23 and FY2023-24) rather
than calendar year.
 Since that time, Canada has worked with Pfizer to confirm delivery schedules
according to public health needs.
 This reprofile request will ensure that funding is available in the appropriate
fiscal year to support public health needs and pay for the vaccines at the time
they are required, beginning in January 2022 (FY2021-22).
o Purpose/objectives
 This request will ensure that funding is available in the correct fiscal year to
support deliveries of the Pfizer vaccine according to public health requirements.
o Expected results
 The Government of Canada will be able to continue to protect the population
against COVID-19 through timely access to vaccines. As variants of concern
spread globally, access to boosters and 2nd generation vaccines will allow
eligible individuals to build on the protection received through the initial
vaccination campaign.
 Investments in Canada’s vaccine portfolio will also allow Canada to meet its
commitment toglobal dose sharing.

 Through investments made in Budget 2020, PHAC received $25 million in 2020-
21 and $65.5 million ongoing to maintain and enhance the stockpile of MCMs in
the National Emergency Strategic Stockpile (NESS).
 Due to contracting and delivery delays, PHAC spent approximately 62% of the

- Safe Restart
o Total Supplementary Estimates (C): $1,975,845
o Key messages
 Existing system and information gaps in the public health surveillance system
have impacted Canada’s ability to monitor and effectively respond to the
COVID-19 epidemic. Many of these gaps reflect systemic, long-standing
challenges affecting Canada’s health and public health data system beyond the
current epidemic, including: issues with timeliness of data for public health and
policy decision-making; completeness of data provided; granularity of the data
to monitor and understand the impact on sub populations; access to data for
rapid conversion of data to intelligence; standards in data reporting; and lack of
identifiers to facilitate data linkage.
 In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, improvements are needed to:
 Ensure availability of timely and critical data to inform decision-making by
addressing, in the short-term, system and knowledge gaps that hinder our
ability to monitor and effectively respond to the COVID-19 epidemic;
 Enhance capacity and infrastructure to support effective pan-Canadian
exchange of critical data via a longer-term plan to transform and modernize
Canada’s health and public health data system.
 In doing so, Canada will be better prepared to identify, prevent, monitor and
respond to not only the current COVID-19 pandemic, but also future health and
public health issues, thus protecting the health of Canadians and supporting the
economy.
o Purpose/objectives
 Under the Data Management Pillar of the SRA's'Testing, Tracing and Data
Management's priority, the Public Health Agency of Canada received funding to
undertake respective activities to:
 Improve data on ‘unintended consequences’ of public health measures and the
wider health impacts of the pandemic;
 Improve data on health system impact;
 Expand data sources; and
 Improve critical health system infrastructure.
o Expected results
 The need for continued data on the wider health impacts of the pandemic,
particularly in the face of the pandemic's second wave and the associated
extended and enhanced public health measures, means that funds are still
required to carry out this work as originally intended. For example, by funding
an additional round of data collection through the Survey on COVID-19 and
Mental Health. Given that the funding allocated through the Safe Restart
Agreement was for only one year, PHACis seeking approval to reprofile from
the 2020-21 FY to the 2021-22 FY, to be able to continue to undertake the
activities planned to address the outstanding evidence gaps.

- Indigenous Early Learning and Child Care Framework (IELCC)
o Total Supplementary Estimates (C): $ 1,916,198
o Key messages
 Through Budget 2016, the Government invested $11.9 billion in the Investing in
Canada Plan (IICP) to support improvements in public transit, green
infrastructure, and social infrastructure. Of this amount, the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC) received$15.4 million to support capital
infrastructure investments in Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern
Communities (AHSUNC) project sites.
 To date, 77 capital and quality improvement projects have been completed at
AHSUNC sites across Canada, with $1.9 million remaining for capital
improvements in the north. Given the remote and isolated nature of the
Nunavut communities, there have been significant challenges in identifying a
suitable project manager to lead the complex infrastructure projects. Overthe
past 18 months, PHAC has explored a number of different options to complete
the work. These have included an investigation into whether Natural Resources
Canada’s innovative MODULARIS building structures could work. However, this
option proved not to be feasible, because acquisition of MODULARIS structures
is restricted to federal departments. Furthermore, PHAC cannot purchase
capital assets and then transfer them to recipients.
 PHAC then explored the possibility of leveraging the Government of Nunavut
(GN) tendering process. This option did not prove to be feasible as GN had other
ideas about where infrastructure investments are needed that do not
correspond with AHSUNC program objectives. PHAC also explored partnering
with ESDC to support infrastructure investments at AHSUNC sites in the north.
However, this option did not address the need to identify a recipient that would
be willing to oversee the project.
o Purpose/objectives
 Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI) has expressed a willingness to undertake the
infrastructure projects at the three remaining AHSUNC sites in the north. The
investments align with the highest needs identified by community leaders; with
the results of recent building assessments; and with the overall goals of the IICP
funding.
o Expected results
 NTI has been invited to submit a funding request for the $1.9M, including a
proposed budget and work plan. PHAC and NTI are in the process of finalizing a
contribution agreement.
 In order to support these important investments, we require the funds to be

 Budget 2017 provided funding for climate change adaptation programs to
support the implementation of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth
and Climate Change (PCF), including those of the health portfolio. The Public
Health Agency of Canada received a total of $42.8 million over 11 years (2017-
2028) for the Infectious Disease and Climate Change (IDCC) Program and the
establishment of grants and contributions fund (IDCC Fund).
 Launched in 2017, the Infectious Disease and Climate Change Fund (IDCCF)
focusses on climate-driven infectious diseases that are zoonotic, food-borne
and/or water-borne. The Fund is a vehicle to advance action, raise awareness
and help Canadians better adapt and become more resilient to our changing
climate.
 The IDCCF also received $800,000 of dedicated funding to work with the Métis
Nation to address the health effects of climate change. Program officials have
been engaging with representatives of the Métis National Council and
Governing Members since August 2017 to set up bilateral funding agreements
to enable the transfer of funds.
o Purpose/objectives
 Various pandemic restrictions have caused significant delays for many Infectious
Disease and Climate Change Fund (IDCCF) projects (e.g. recruiting, citizen
science, laboratory analysis, consultation and engagement, redirection of
project staff to COVID-19 response efforts), leading recipients to postpone many
activities originally planned for 2020-2021 fiscal year to 2021-2022 fiscal year.
 This reprofile request seeks to move surplus funds from 2020-2021 fiscal year
into 2021-2022 fiscal year for the IDCCF as well as the dedicated funding for the
Métis Nation. This reprofile will allow recipients to complete projects and
enable the program to increase capacity and deliver on the IDCC Program's
overall objectives. In addition, this will allow PHAC to deliver on the
government's commitment to the Métis Nation to support the advancement of
climate change and health activities through a distinctions-based approach.
o Expected results
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic PHAC has lapsed a total of $443,149 of funds
relatedto the Infectious Disease and Climate Change Program in 2020-2021. Of
these lapsing funds, PHAC lapsed $200,902 in the delivery of the core program
(program funds) and $242,247 related to the dedicated funding and
commitment to the Métis Nation. Thereforea total of $443,149 is being
requested to reprofile into 2021-2022.
 This reprofile request is for the unspent funds from 2020-2021 to be reprofiled
into 2021-2022. This is required to allow for the continued funding of activities
and to provide recipients with additional time to successfully complete project
objectives.

LEGISLATIVE REVIEWOF THE CANNABIS ACT (85 words)
• The Cannabis Act established a new control framework for cannabis designed to better protect
public health and public safety, and minimize harms associated with cannabis use.
• The Act requires a legislative review to start three yearsafter coming into force, and a report to
be tabled in both Houses of Parliament within 18 months after the review begins.
• Our Government is committed to putting into place a credible, evidence-driven process for the
legislative review, which will assess the progress made towards achieving the Act’s objectives.
IF PRESSED ON INCLUDING THE MEDICAL ACCESSREGIME IN THE REVIEW (51 words)
• Health Canada is committed to actively monitoring and evaluating patients’ reasonable access
tocannabis for medical purposes.
• Health Canada acknowledges the significant stakeholder interest in the access to cannabis for
medical purposes framework and recognizes the opportunity that the legislative review presents to hear
the views and perspectives of these stakeholders.
BACKGROUND
The Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018, creating a strict legal framework for controlling
the production, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis across Canada. The Act aims to keep
cannabis out of the hands of youth and keep profits out of the pockets of criminals and organized crime.
Section 151.1 of the Cannabis Act requires that the Minister initiate a review of the Act and its
administration three years following the coming into force of the Act (i.e., after October 17, 2021), and
that a report of the review’s findings be tabled before both Houses of Parliament within 18 months of
the start of the review.
The Cannabis Act further stipulates that the review must include an assessment of the impact of the
Cannabis Act on public health and, in particular, on: the health and consumption habits of young
persons in respect of cannabis use; Indigenous persons and communities; and, the cultivation of
cannabis plants in a dwelling-house.
Over the past three years, the Minister of Health, with the support of the Minister of Public Safety and
Emergency Preparedness and the Minister of Justice, and together with provinces and territories, as well
as Indigenous leaders, have worked diligently to implement the cannabis legislative framework.
The Government of Canada has made progress toward the implementation of the cannabis framework
by putting in place measures aimed at protecting children and youth from accessing cannabis;
establishing a strictly regulated, legal supply chain for cannabis, and by making significant investments in
public education, awareness, research, monitoring and surveillance efforts.
The review provides an initial and early opportunity to assess progress towards achieving the objectives
of the Act, and to help ensure that the legislation is meeting the needs and expectations of Canadians
through a credible, evidence-driven review process.
Health Canada has been actively monitoring the perspectives of stakeholders, including industry, public
health experts, and the law enforcement community and is taking into account the views and
expectations of stakeholders as we prepare for the review. Particular emphasis has been placed on early
engagement with Indigenous communities and to helping ensure that the review process reflects their
interests and expectations.

BACKGROUND
Medical Regime
Health Canada administers the medical access program under the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis
Regulations.
As of December 2021, there were more than 250,000 patients registered with federally licensed sellers
(Note: these are not always unique individuals as individuals may be registered with more than one
licensed seller, provided an original medical document was used with each registration).
As of December 2021, there were more than 47,000 individuals registered with Health Canada for
personal and designated productionof cannabis for their own medical purposes.
Licensed cannabis producers must pay a federal excise duty when they package cannabis products,
including those sold to patients for medical purposes. Federal policies related to excise duties on
cannabis fall under the purview of the Minister of Finance.
Authorizations for personal or designated production
Canadians who have been authorized by their health care practitioner can access cannabis for medical
purposes by producing cannabis or by designating someone to produce it for them.
Personal and designated production are subject to regulatory requirements, which are designed to
ensure that cannabis is consumed only with the approval and under the supervision of an authorized
health care practitioner.
Health Canada reviews all applications for personal or designated production to ensure that the
regulatory requirements are met. Health Canada also confirms that the health care practitioner is
authorized by—and in good standing with—the relevant provincial orterritorial regulatory health
authority, and that the medical document is an original that has not been altered or falsified.
Once a registration certificate is issued, the personal or designated producer may not produce in excess
of the maximum limits outlined in a registration certificate, and may not sell cannabis to any person.
Selling cannabis without authorization is a criminal offence.
A maximum of four registrations are permitted per production site. Only the individuals authorized to
produce cannabis for their own medical purposes, or the person designated to produce it for them, can
tend to the plants.
Health Canada appreciates that, as in any regulatory framework, there will be instances where
individuals choose to operate outside of the law.Health Canada supports law enforcement
representatives on a daily basis by providing a dedicated service 24 hours a day and seven days a week
to confirm, when necessary, that specific individuals are authorized to produce cannabis for medical
purposes.
Health Canada has the ability to inspect a production site if it is not the registrant’s home to ensure it is
abiding by the terms set out in the individual’s registration certificate.

are suffering.
• The safety and well-being of Canadians is the paramount concern. At this time, there are no
approved therapeutic products containing psilocybin in Canada or elsewhere.
• This means there is no product containing psilocybin that has been assessed for itssafety,
efficacy and quality.
• Clinical trials remain the best method to advance our knowledge about products with a possible
medical benefit, such as psilocybin. Clinical trials protect patients by providing a framework so that a
potential treatment is administered in accordance with national and international ethical, medical and
scientific standards.
• For emergency treatment purposes or by exception, and on compassionate grounds, there are
pathways to access these substances.
• Health Canada's Special Access Program (SAP) permits health care practitioners to request
access to drugs that have shown promise in clinical trials, or been approved in other countries, but that

patients who are terminally ill.
IF PRESSED ON THE SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAM AND ACCESS TO A “SECURE SUPPLY” OF PSILOCYBIN (87
words)
• Health Canada has not evaluated the efficacy and safety of psilocybin, nor has it approved its
sale for therapeutic use underthe Food and Drug Regulations.
• As of January 5, 2022, health care practitioners can request access, on behalf of patients with
serious or life-threatening conditions, to restricted drugs such as psilocybin, through the Special Access
Program. All requests are assessedon a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the patient’s
condition, availability of other treatment options, and available evidence of the safety and efficacy of
the drug.
BACKGROUND
Use of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes in Canada
Canadians are increasingly seeking novel approaches for the treatment of mental health issues. As such,
interest in the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics for the treatment of mental health disorders is
on the rise.
Psilocybin is one of the active ingredients in magic mushrooms, while MDMA is a synthetic compound
made in laboratories. There are many different kinds of psychedelics including LSD (acid), DMT
(ayahuasca), mescaline (peyote), etc. Many psychedelics are being studied as an adjunct therapy
alongside conventional psychotherapeutic techniques in clinical settings. This is also known as
psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
Most psychedelics (also known as hallucinogens) are controlled as “restricted drugs” under the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). Restricted drugs generally have no approved therapeutic
uses and can only be used for research or scientific purposes, including in authorized clinical trials. No
products containing psilocybin have been approved in the US, Canada, or internationally.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated psilocybin as a “breakthrough-
therapy” for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression/Major Depressive Disorder. Similarly,
MDMA has received “breakthrough-therapy” designation for the treatment of PTSD by the FDA. A
“breakthrough-therapy” designation is a process designed to fast track the drug review and approval
process for drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence
indicates that the drug may be a substantial improvement over existing therapeutic options for a
particular medical condition.
Access to psilocybin
Psychedelics are subject to legal controls under the Food and Drugs Act and the CDSA. This means that
access to psilocybin and other psychedelic restricted drugs must be authorized by Health Canada. At this
time, there are three possible options for individuals to access restricted drugs, namely through
participation in an approved clinical trial, through the Special Access Program, and through a subsection
56(1) exemption under the CDSA.
Clinical trials
Health Canada has approved several clinical trials with psilocybin since 2018. These include clinical trials
to assess the efficacy of psilocybin in patients with depression or treatment-resistant depression, the
safety of low-doses of psilocybin, and the safety of psilocybin for health careproviders enrolled in a
psychedelic training program.
Special Access Program
On January 5, 2022, regulatory amendments were made to the Food and Drug Regulations and Narcotic
Control Regulations allowing practitioners, on behalf of patients with serious orlife-threatening
conditions, to request access to restricted drugs through the Special Access Program when other
therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or are unavailable in Canada. All requests will continue to be
assessed on a case-by-case basis takinginto consideration the patient’s condition and the level of
evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of the drug. These regulatory changes were shared with all
interested parties, including organizations that represent patients seeking to possess and usepsilocybin
for therapeutic purposes.
Individual subsection 56(1) exemptions
As for exemptions, Health Canada continues to receive a high volume of requests pertaining to
psilocybin, and, more recently, MDMA. Health Canada continues to prioritize exemption requests from
terminally ill patients seeking access to psilocybin for the treatment of end-of-life distress.
Many factors are considered when reviewing and making a decision on a request for a subsection 56(1)
exemption to use psilocybin in relation to a medical condition. These factors may include but are not
limited to (as per Health Canada web page):
• The availability of clinical trials or other regulatory pathways, such as the Special Access
Program, to request access to the substance
• The medical condition for which the psilocybin is requested to be used
• The existing scientific evidence to support the use of psilocybin for the treatment of the
condition
• Whether other conventional therapies have been considered
• Whether the use of the substances is supported by a health care practitioner
• Public health and public safety objectives of the CDSA
• Other federal, provincial, and/or municipal laws or regulations that may apply to the proposed
activity
• Risks, including risk of diversion
Number of Patient-Requested Exemptions Approved
Health Canada has granted exemptions under subsection 56(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances
Act to patients with serious or life threatening illnesses, when conventional treatments have failed, to
allow themto possess psilocybin while undergoing psychotherapy, as well as to a small number of
health care professionals for professional training purposes. Total subsection 56(1) exemptions issued
for possession and use of psilocybin included below.

IF PRESSED ON PRIVATE MEMBER’S BILL C-216 (103 words)
• We recognise that more needs to be done to addressthe worsening overdose crisis.
• Through the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy, we are supporting a comprehensive
public health-focused approach. This includes investments of over $700M to address the overdose crisis
and substance use-related harms since 2017.
• We are also supporting measures to divert people who use drugs away from the criminal justice
system and towards health and social services, as in Bill C-5, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
• The Bill is currently under review by federal officials. I look forward to receiving their
assessment.
BACKGROUND
The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) generally prohibits activities (e.g. possession,
production, sale) with controlled substances and precursors (including chemicals used to make illegal
drugs), unless those activities have been specifically authorized through regulations or an exemption
under the Act. Current criminal penalties for simple possession of some controlled substances can
include imprisonment up to seven years and/or fines.
Section 56 of the CDSA allows the Minister of Health to exempt any person or class of persons or any
controlled substance or precursor or class thereof from the application of all or any of the provisions of
the Act or the regulationsif, in the opinion of the Minister, the exemption is necessary for a medical or
scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.
As the overdose crisis continues to worsen, there have been increasing calls from stakeholders,
including health professionals, law enforcement and people with lived and living experience, for the
removal of criminal penalties for the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use in order to
treat substance use as a health issue, reduce stigma around substance use and help connect people who
use drugs with health and social services.
Calls from jurisdictions across Canada to allow for personal possession of controlled substances are
increasing. To date HC is aware of over fifty-five municipalities who have publicly expressed interest in
decriminalization of personal possession. Several municipalities are studying or have advocated for the
federal government to decriminalize the possession of drugs for personal use, including Regina,
Saskatoon, Montreal and Ontario’s Big City Mayors (mayors from the province’s 29 largest cities).
On May 28, 2021, the City of Vancouver submitted its application with respect to its request for a
section 56 exemption under the CDSA to allow for the personal possession of certain amounts of
controlled substances. On November 1, 2021, British Columbia submitted an application with respect to
its request for a section 56 exemption under the CDSA to allow for the personal possession of certain
controlled substances commonly associated with overdose deaths in the province. On January 4, 2022,
Toronto Public Health submitted its request for a section 56 exemption under the CDSA to decriminalize
personal possession of small amounts of controlled substances within the city’s boundaries. During a
December 6 Board of Health (BoH) meeting, the Toronto BoH also reiterated its call to request the
Federal Minister of Health to use their authority under the CDSA to develop a national framework to
permit the possession of certain amounts of controlled substances for personal use; and support the
immediate scale up of prevention, harm reduction and treatment services. The requests from British
Columbia, Vancouver, and Toronto Public Health are currently under review. Several other
municipalities have reached out to Health Canada for additional information on the exemption process
for such requests including Calgary (December 18, 2021) and Edmonton (January 25, 2022). In response,
Health Canada has provided the type of information that could be helpful in informing the Department’s
review.
In addition to requests from jurisdictions to decriminalize simple possession, the Canadian Association
of People who Use Drugs (CAPUD) and four individual plaintiffs filed a Notice of Civil Claim on August 31,
2021 in the British Columbia Supreme Court that aims to decriminalize possession of all drugs, as well as
drug trafficking activities that are connected to subsistence, supporting personal drug use, or providing a
safe supply of drugs to other people who use drugs (“necessity trafficking”). The Government of Canada
filed a Response to Civil Claim on November 30, 2021, which sets out the facts and basic legal arguments
of the Government of Canada’s defence. The plaintiffs filed a reply to the Government of Canada’s
response on December 23, 2021. The litigation generated some media attention in September, and
continued interest is anticipated.
Under the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy, the Government of Canada has taken a number of
steps to help create pathways away from the criminal justice system toward appropriate health services
and social supports for people who use drugs. This includes:
• In May 2017, the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act became law. It provides some legal
protection related to personal possession for individuals who seek emergency help during an overdose.
• On August 18, 2020, the Public Prosecution Service of Canada issued public guidance to
prosecutors stating that alternatives to prosecution should be considered for personal possession
offences, except when there are serious aggravating circumstances.
On December 15, 2021, Gord Johns, Member of Parliament for Courtenay-Alberni, BC (NDP), introduced
Private Member’s Bill C-216, an Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to enact the
Expungement of Certain Drug-related Convictions Act and the National Strategy on Substance Use Act,
in the House of Commons. The Bill is divided into three parts:
• Part 1 would repeal sections 4 and 4.1 of the CDSA, thereby removing the prohibition on
possession of controlled substances (i.e. subsection 4(1) of the CDSA) and other provisions;
• Part 2 would establish a procedure for expunging convictions related to possession of controlled
substances through the Parole Board of Canada;and
• Part 3 would require the Minister of Health to develop a national strategy to address substance-
related harms.
The first hour of debate at second reading took place on March 2, 2022.
In February 2021, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General introduced Bill C-22 in Parliament, An Act
to amend the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Amongst other measures, the
Bill would have police and prosecutors consider alternative measures–including diverting individuals to
addiction programs, giving a warning or taking no further actions–instead of laying charges or
prosecuting individuals for simple drug possession. Bill C-22 died on the order paper with the calling of
the 2021 federal election. These proposed measures were reintroduced in the House of Commons on
December 7, 2021, through Bill C-5.

BACKGROUND
Tobacco use in Canada
Data released on September 8th 2021, from the 2020 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), show
the largest annual smoking decline in the survey’s history, decreasing from 4.7M to 4.2M Canadians 12
years of age and older. Decades of tobacco control have seen positive impacts, resulting in a national
average rate of 13% (4.2M) down from 15% (4.7M) in 2019. Daily smoking also declined to 9% (2.9M)
from 10% (3.2M) in 2019. A reliable estimate on daily smoking for youth aged 15-19 cannot be
determined for 2020.
While the recent declines are positive,millions of Canadians are still smoking, reminding us that, despite
decades of effort to deter smoking, tobacco use remains a significant public health problem in Canada.
Tobacco use is still the leading cause of premature death in Canada, killing half ofall Canadians who
smoke daily for a long time. Furthermore, prevalence rates for on-reserve First Nations and Inuit are
higher than that of other Canadians.
In July 2020, the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction released an update of its report
entitled “Canadian Substance Use Costs and Harms 2015–2017”. The report identifies the enormous
burden tobacco use places on all Canadians. The report found that in 2017 the total cost of tobacco use
to society was approximately $12.3 billion or $336 for every Canadian. Tobacco use was identified as the
deadliest and most costly substance by far accounting for 47% of all attributable health care costs from
substance use and approximately 48,000 premature deaths in 2017 (over 128 deaths per day or 17% of
all deaths).
Canada’s Tobacco Strategy
Canada’s Tobacco Strategy represents the Government of Canada’s plan to address tobacco use. It is led
by Health Canada, in partnership with the Canada Border Services Agency, the Canada Revenue Agency,
IndigenousServices Canada, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, the Public Health
Agency of Canada, Public Safety Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Tobacco Cost Recovery/Levy
Minister Bennett’s mandate letter includes a commitment to require tobacco manufacturers to pay for
the cost of federal public health investments in tobacco control. Health Canada is working closely with
other Government of Canada partners to examine options and determine next steps.
Both the Conservative Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party made similar commitments in
their election platforms.
YOUTH VAPING (71 words)
• Our Government is concerned by the high rates of youth vaping, andis taking comprehensive
action.
• Regulationsnow prohibit the promotion and advertising of vaping products anywhere theycan
be seen or heard by youth.
• New regulations are also now in force setting a maximum nicotine concentration for all vaping
products, and Health Canada has consulted Canadians on proposed regulations to restrict flavours in
vaping products to make them less attractive.
IF PRESSED ON THE YOUTH-ORIENTED PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN (83 words)
• In 2019, Health Canada launched the Consider the Consequences of Vaping prevention
campaign, investingmore than $14 million to date.
• The campaign has included in-print and online advertising, as well as an interactive learning tour
in schools and community venues or virtually. Vaping awareness kits were provided to all middle and
high schools, and information resources sent to health care professionals.
• The interactive learning tour has reached over 140,000 youth in over 515 schools across the
country, and will continue to reach more.
IF PRESSED ON COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENTOF CURRENT MEASURES (88 words)
• The Tobacco and Vaping Products Act has significant restrictions in place to limit youth access to
vaping products and promotions.
• Health Canada has taken actions that have led companies to remove lifestyle advertising from

• In 2019, Health Canada inspected more than 3,000 retailers and seized more than 80,000 units
of non-compliant vaping products. Between July 2020 and March 2021, over 300 online inspections of
Canadian vaping retailers’ Instagram accounts were conducted and approximately 160 warning letters
issued.
IF PRESSED ON THE LEGISLATIVE REVIEW (56 words)
• Section 60.1(1) of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) requires a legislativereview of

IF PRESSED ONFLAVOURS REGULATIONS (69 words)
• On June 19th, 2021, Health Canada published the proposed order to amend the Tobacco and
Vaping Products Act (flavours) and the proposed Standards for Vaping Products’Sensory Attributes
Regulations.
• The proposed regulations would implement a complementary three-pronged approach to
restricting the flavours of vaping products.
• The consultations closed on September 2, 2021 and Health Canada received over 25,000
submissions and is currently reviewing the inputit received from Canadians.
BACKGROUND
Since late 2018, the Government of Canada has implemented a comprehensive suite of measures to
address youth vaping, including enhanced public education, increased compliance and enforcement of
existing rules and advancing regulations to putin place more controls.
Health Canada’s national public education campaign “Consider the Consequences of Vaping” informs
youth and their parents about the risks and harms associated with vaping through advertising,
interactive learning tours in schools and online. To date, Health Canada hasinvested more than $14
million.
Enforcing the strong set of controls already established under the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act
remains an important part of the Government’s efforts. The department has taken action to shut down
illegal promotions by major national brands.
Regulations
The Vaping Products Promotion Regulations came into force on August 7, 2020. These regulations
prohibit any vaping product promotions in locations or media visible to youth. Additionally, the
regulations require all remaining permitted ads to include clearhealth warnings to increase awareness
of the risks of these products.
In addition, the Vaping Product Labeling and Packaging Regulations came into force on July 1, 2020.
These regulations require that vaping products containing nicotine display a standardized nicotine
concentration statement and a health warning about the addictiveness of nicotine as well as a toxicity
warning to further increase awareness of the risks.
On July 8, 2021, new Nicotine Concentration in Vaping Products Regulations came into force, which set a
maximum nicotine concentration for vaping products sold to 20 mg/ml, down from 66 mg/ml. As of July
23, 2021, it is prohibited to sell any vaping products with a nicotine concentration higher than 20 mg/ml
in Canada.
Building on feedback from consultations in 2019, on June 19th, 2021, Health Canada published the
proposed Order Amending Schedules 2 and 3 to the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (flavours) and the
proposed Standards for Vaping Products’ Sensory Attributes Regulations. The proposal is a three-
pronged approach to restricting flavoured vaping products. The regulations would restrict the
promotion of flavours in vaping products to tobacco, mint, and menthol; prohibit all sugars and
sweeteners and most flavouring ingredients; and prescribe sensory attributes standards to prevent a
sensory perception other than one that is typical of tobacco or mint/menthol. The consultation period
for the proposed regulations closed September 2, 2021 and the department is reviewing feedback on
this proposal.
On April 19, 2021, Finance Canada announced its intention to implement a tax on vaping products in
2022, through the introduction of a new excise duty framework. The proposed framework would
impose a single flat rate duty on every 10 millilitres(ml) of vaping liquid or fraction thereof, within an
immediate container (i.e., the container holding the liquid itself). Finance Canada requested input from
industry and stakeholders on the proposal by June 30, 2021, and is reviewing the feedback received.
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death and disease in Canada. Smoking-related
disease is caused by the toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in smoke. Vaping products expose users to far
fewer toxic chemicals and substances than conventional cigarettes, and are less harmful alternatives to
tobacco products if they quit smoking and switch completely to vaping.
However, vaping is not harmless. Vaping nicotine can lead to addiction and physical dependence and
youth are especially susceptible to the negative effects of nicotine. Moreover, the long-term health
effects of vaping are unknown. For these reasons, the TVPA seeks to protect the health of youth and
non-users from exposure to and dependence on nicotine, and help ensure that Canadians are not misled
with regard to the health hazards of using vaping products and/or nicotine.
Results from the Canadian Tobacco and Nicotine (CTNS) survey in 2019 showed a rapid increase in youth
aged 15-19 from the previous survey, with 14% reporting past 30 day use compared to 6% in 2017.
Health Canada has not seen a corresponding increase in student smoking rates; these rates continue to
be at all-time lows.
In March 2021, Statistics Canada released the 2020 CTNS results that indicated youth vaping rates have
not increased from the previous survey in 2019. While the rates remain high, more data is needed to
determine a potential trend; results from the 2021 CTNS are expected in April 2022. Health Canada will
be closely monitoring youth use of vaping products through the CTNS.
Section 60.1(1) of the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act (TVPA) requires that the Minister perform a
legislative review of the Act on a two year cycle, three years after thelegislation comes into force.
The US Food and Drug Administration, under its Premarket Tobacco Product Application process, has
reviewed the applications of over 6 million vaping products to determine whether any meet the criteria
of protecting public health, taking into account the risks and benefits to thepopulation as a whole.
While the review process has not been completed, on October 12, 2021, the United States Food and
Drug Administration announced it had authorized the marketing of three new electronic nicotine
delivery systems (ENDS). The FDA issuedorders to R.J. Reynolds (RJR) Vapor Company authorizing
marketing for its Vuse Solo closed ENDS device and accompanying tobacco-flavored e-liquid pods. The
RJR Vapor Company submitted data to the FDA that demonstrated that the marketing of these products
is appropriate for the protection of public health, and the authorization allows these productsto be
legally sold in the U.S.
For these three products, the FDA determined that the potential benefit to smokers who switch
completely or significantly reduce their cigarette use, would outweigh the risk to youth, provided the
applicant follows post-marketing requirements aimed at reducing youth exposure and access to the
products (e.g., regular reporting to the FDA, marketing restrictions for digital, radio andtelevision
advertising).
In Canada, the Food and Drugs Act applies to vaping products that make health claims, such as help to
quit smoking. These products must be authroized under this act before they can be advertised, sold, or
commercially imported. Todate, no vaping products have been authorized under this Act and no
applications have been received.

unprecedentedpublic health threats in Canada’s history.
• This is why we have invested over $700 million since 2017 to address this crisis, including $116
million provided in Budget 2021 to support a range of innovative, community-led harm reduction,
treatment and prevention measures.
• These measures include safer supply projects to provide a medically supervised alternative to
the contaminated drug supply, training for health and social workers to increase support for people who
use drugs, and national naloxone distribution.
IF PRESSED ON HOW BUDGET2021 IS BEING SPENT (94 words)
• Our government is committed to a comprehensive public health approach that is focused on
reducing harm, saving lives, and gettingpeople the supports they need.
• Funding announced in Budget 2021 will go to national and community-level organizations
through Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP) for projects that could include
safer drug supply, training for health and social workers to increase support for people whouse drugs,
andnational naloxone distribution
• Health Canada is currently assessing over 400 proposals from national and community-level
organizations and will make funding decisions as soon as possible.
IF PRESSED ON PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS (119 words)
• The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened long-standing challenges regarding substance use and
the overdose crisis, with most jurisdictions reporting record high ratesof overdose deaths and harms.
• In addition, people who use drugs are also facing additional barriers and risks related to the
toxicity of the illegal drug supply and reduced access to health and social services, including life-saving
harm reduction and treatment services.
• The Government of Canada has committed over $700 million since 2017 to address this crisis,
including $182 million to community organizations.
• This includes $150 million through the Emergency Treatment Fund for provinces and territories
to improve access to evidence-based treatment services, which, when cost-matched by provinces and
territories, will result in an investment over $300 million.
BACKGROUND
Most recent national data indicates that 24,626 apparent opioid toxicity deaths occurred between
January 2016 and June 2021. Fentanyl and its analogues continue to be major drivers of the crisis with
as many as 87% of accidental apparent opioid toxicity deaths so far in 2021 (January to June) involving
fentanyl. While Canadians of all walks of life are affected, there are striking patterns, with death most
common among males and individuals aged 20 to 49 years old.
The COVID-19 pandemic is compounding the ongoing overdose crisis, and people who use drugs are
experiencing higher risks related to an increasingly toxic illegal drug supply and reduced access to
treatment and harm reduction services. Several jurisdictions have observed unprecedented numbers
and rates in relation to the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Although these increases have been observed across the country, Western Canada continues to be
highly impacted. In 2020, the British Columbia Coroners Service reported 1,724 illegal drug toxicity
deaths, a 75% increase over the number of deaths in 2019. Additionally, the crisis in British Columbia
(BC) continues into 2021 where the number of deaths so far in2021 is the highest ever recorded in first
nine months of a year (January to September 2021-1,534 deaths), and a 24% increase over the same
time last year (January to September 2020–1,240 deaths). Tragically, overdose deaths among First
Nations peoplein BC have also surged, increasing by 119% in 2020 compared to 2019. In 2020, Alberta
also experienced a 61% increase in opioid overdose deaths among First Nations people, when compared
with the same period in 2019.
HEALTH CANADA’S SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTIONS (SUAP) PROGRAM
SUAP provides grants and contributions (G&C) funding to other levels of government, community-led
and not-for-profit organizations, Indigenous organizations, and other groups, to respond to drug and
substance use issues in Canada. The program supports a wide range of evidence-informed and
innovative initiatives in the areas of prevention, harm reduction, and treatment (e.g. education and
awareness activities, access to safer supply, drug checking, managed alcohol programming, pain
management). Initiatives target a range of substances, including opioids, stimulants, cannabis, alcohol,
nicotine, tobacco and vaping.
In 2021/2022, the Government has already invested $89 million in G&C through SUAP to support almost
200 projects across Canada. To further support communities working to address the ongoing opioid
crisis and problematic substance use, Budget 2021 provided an additional $116 million over two years
(2021/2022 and 2022/2023) for SUAP to support a range of innovative approachesto harm reduction,
treatment, and prevention.
On July 23, 2021, a national call for proposals was launched to solicit new proposals from a broad range
of applicants. Over 400 applications were received by the close of the application period on September
24, 2021, representing over $350 million in potential new investments. Assessments of these proposals
are underway and decisions are expected this winter.
FEDERAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS
Since 2017, the federal government has taken significant actions and has committed over $700 million
to address the overdose crisis and substance use-related harms. Additional actions to date include:
improved access to treatment and harm reduction, reduced regulatory barriers to treatment;
strengthened lawenforcement, developed of educational products and tools for the public and health
care providers, and research and surveillance to build the evidence base.
This includes Budget 2019 investments of $106.7 million over five years with $1 million ongoingand $66
million announced in the Fall Economic Statement (December 2020) to help support community-based
organizations responding to substance use issues address the additional challenges posted by the
COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2021, the government announced $20 million in funding for the
distribution of naloxone kits and opioid overdose response training to support communities that have
been particularly affected by the opioid overdose crisis and are experiencing challenges in improving
health outcomes of their residents. As noted earlier in this note, Budget 2021 also committed an
additional $116 million to fund projects through the Substance Use and Addictions Program (SUAP).
In addition to these investments, the Government of Canada has also taken action to make it easier for
people being treated for substance use disorder to access medications and for frontline service
providers to establish overdose prevention sites in temporary shelters.
The Minister of Health established an Expert Task Force onSubstance Use in March 2021 that provided
expert advice on Canada’s federal drug policy, including examining potential alternatives to criminal
penalties for personal drug possession. The Task Force provided its final advice on alternatives to
criminal penalties in May 2021, and on federal drug policy in June 2021. Both reports of the Task Force
have been made publicly available and can be found online at https://www.canada.ca/en/health-
canada/corporate/about-health-canada/public-engagement/external-advisory-bodies/expert-task-
force-substance-use/reports.html.

BACKGROUND
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on mental health across the population, with
concerns about the virus itself compounded by impacts on work and routines, financial stress, social
isolation, grief and bereavement, and reduced access to services and supports. These impacts have been
particularly acute for certain groups, including children and youth, older adults, First Nations, Métis,
Inuit, and Black and other racialized populations.
During the pandemic, frontline and essential workers (e.g. health workers, public safety and social
services providers and long-term care workers) have experienced higher workload, stressorsand new
challenges. These workers are at risk of stress, anxiety, vicarious trauma, moral injury, and
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
With Canadians physical distancing and isolated, there is an unprecedented need for virtual services,
such as telehealth and other information lines (e.g., 811), and provinces/territories are not able to
absorb the increased demand.
It is critical that Canadians have access to effective tools to self-monitor, promote their mental well-
being, obtain credible and reliable information, and access services when deemed necessary. Canadians
need to be re-assured that there are supports available to help alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.
Government Actions and Investments to Improve Access to Mental Health Services and Address the
Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians’ Mental Health
PHAC Investments
The Government of Canada has responded by establishing time-limited funding for the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC) to address the mental health needs of prioritypopulations in the context of
COVID-19. Through Budget 2021, the Government of Canada is providing:
· $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19

National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government has allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22,to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadians can access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health.
Wellness Together Canada
Health Canada has invested $130 million over two years in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support andconfidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as by phone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist with finding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national service offering support to young people via
phone, text and live chat, and is a global leader in developing and delivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ accessto mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of morethan $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As part of this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence
Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $333
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects
led by experts across the country.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative currently supports 101 research projects, representing a total
investment of $13.5 million from CIHRand partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel
composed of leading Canadian experts in mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated
through these projects will be mobilized to ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
Election 2021 Platform Commitments for Mental Health
The Government of Canada is working to initiate and implement mental health commitments made
during the 2021 election. These include:
• Establishing a new federal transfer-the Canada Mental Health Transfer-to provinces and
territories to expand the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental health services. This
includes a commitment to permanent, ongoing funding for mental health services under the Canada
Mental Health Transfer, withan initial investment of $4.5 billion over 5 years;
• Introducing a new fund for student well-being to improve wait times and increase access to
mental health care at colleges and universities, including by hiring up to 1,200 new mental health care
counsellors, including those who can support the needs of Black, Indigenous, and racialized students;
• Fully funding a national, three-digit mental health crisis and suicide prevention hotline;
• Committing an additional $1.4 billion for a co-developed mental health and wellness strategy
with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis Nation partners;

IF PRESSEDON SPECIFIC ACTIONS (85 words)
• In April 2020, in response to the global public health challenge of COVID-19, the Government of
Canada launched Wellness Together Canada (WTC), an online mental health and substance use support
portal that provides free and credible supports available 24/7 to individuals across Canada.
• The accessibility of the WTC portal has demonstrated that it can be quickly deployed to provide
support during times of crisis, such as in the recent BC floods, where a nimble and coordinated approach
to address urgent mental health needs is required.
BACKGROUND
Risks from climate change to the health of Canadians, their communities and their health systems are
great and continue to grow as the country continues to warm. Canadians are already feeling the effects
of climate change on their health, including from very severe events like heatwaves, wildfires, floods
and droughts and the expansion of vector-borne diseases, like Lyme disease, into Canada. Recent events
such as the catastrophic heatwave in British Columbia (BC) this past summer, which resulted in the
deaths of an estimated 740 people, show how severe the effects can be on communities and health
systems. Many climate change health impacts can be prevented if Canada rapidly and substantially
scales up efforts to adapt to growing threats to health.
The current burdenof mental ill-health in Canada is likely to rise as a result of climate change. Given the
very large number of Canadians who experience mental health problems, the potential increase of
mental ill-health outcomes from future climate change is large. Strongadaptation measures can prevent
potential health impacts and make health systems and facilities more resilient to climate change.
On February 9, 2022, Health Canada released the national climate change and health assessment report,
Health of Canadians in a Changing Climate: Advancing our Knowledge for Action. The report was
developed by over 80 experts from across Canada and from within and outside of government. The
objectives of the report are to provide the latest scientific evidence of the risks of climate change to the
health of Canadians and to the health care system and effective adaptations to protect health. The
assessment report was developed as part of the National Climate Change Assessment Process being led
by Natural Resources Canada.
The assessment report covers a range of health-related topics, including (1) Climate Change and Health
Linkages; (2) Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples’ Health in Canada; (3) Natural Hazards; (4) Mental
Health and Well-being; (5) Air Quality; (6) Infectious Diseases; (7) Water Quality, Quantity and Security;
(8) Food Safety and Security; (9) Climate Change and Health Equity; and (10) Adaptation and Health
System Resilience.
Climate change impacts on mental health may also be more generalized and longer termsuch as
increased anxiety and grief that occur due to awareness of climate change effects–often termed
climate/eco-anxiety and climate/ecological grief. Climate change disproportionately affects the mental
health of specific populations, including: FirstNations, Inuit and Metis peoples; women; children; youth;
older adults; people living in low socio-economic conditions including the homeless; people living with
pre-existing physical and mental health conditions; and certain occupational groups such as land-based
workers and first responders.
Given the current high costs of mental illness to society, and the breadth of mental health impacts that
are related to climate change, future costs borne by Canadians and health systems are expected to be
large asthe climate continues to warm.
The assessment report identifies a number of opportunities to reduce risks of climate change to the
mental health of Canadians through:
• Improved access to mental health practitioners, health care facilities, and needed social
services, during and after climate emergencies
• Access to culturally-relevant mental health–for example, for First Nations, Inuit and Metis
Peoples
• Climate change resilience plans that address psychosocial well-being
• Specialized training for community members in psychological First Aid or mental health First Aid
• Resource guides for professionals and the public on addressing the mental health outcomes
relatedto climate change
Well-designed actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change—for
example, active transportation, environmental stewardship, green infrastructure, and enhanced social
networks and community supports—can alsobenefit mental health.
Health Canada is building the capacity of health authorities in Canada to reduce risks from climate
change, including those on mental health. Through its HealthADAPT contribution program it is
supporting health authorities in assessing and addressing risks to health (e.g., mental health) from
climate change. From 2018 to 2022 a total of up to $3.6 million will be invested in partnerships with 10
health authorities across 5 provinces and territories.
For example, the Centre intégré de Santé et de services sociaux (CISSS) de Chaudière-Appalaches is
leading a project to assess and support the health systems capacity of 2 CISSS pilot regions (Chaudière-
Appalaches and Bas-Saint-Laurent) to prevent the negative impacts on mental health andpsychosocial
well-being of populations exposed to extreme climate events.
Key Findings of the Assessment Report
• Climate change is already negatively impacting the health of Canadians.
• Health risks will increase as warming continues, and the greaterthe warming, thegreater the
threats to health.
• Some Canadians are affected more severely by climate change, as exposure and sensitivity to
hazards and the ability to take protective measures varies across and within populations and
communities.
• The effects of climate change on health systems in Canada—for example, damage to health
facilities and disruptions to health services and operations—are already evident and will increase in the
absenceof strong adaptation measures.
• Efforts to prepare forclimate change are known to reduce risks and protect health. We must
take action now.
• The health impacts of climate change on First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples are far-reaching,
with disproportionate impacts on their communities, including food andwater security and safety, air
quality, infrastructure, personal safety, mental health and wellness, livelihoods, culture, and identity.
• To successfully protect all Canadians from the health impacts of climate change, decision makers
must pursue adaptation actions that are inclusive and equitable and consider the needs of racialized,
marginalized, and low income populations.
• Increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are required to help protect the health of
Canadians.
• Reducing greenhousegas emissions can provide very large and immediate health co-benefits to
Canadians.
The findings of the report will support needed adaptation actions by health decision makers at local,
provincial/ territorial and national levels; and support those who work in public health, health care,
emergency management, research and community organizations. The findings will also inform the
development of Canada’s National Adaptation Plan, being led by Environment and Climate Change
Canada.
Government of Canada Action
Federal health organizations including Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Indigenous Services
Canada work together, in collaboration with otherlevels of government and stakeholders, to address
key impacts of climate change on health and the health system.
Highlights of the federal government’s work already underway to protect Canadians through efforts to
reduce risk from climate changeinclude:
• Health Canada’s HealthADAPT contribution program supports health authorities in assessing and
addressing climate change risks, which has so far supported ten projects as a pilot.
• Through Health Canada’s Heat Program, 77% of health regions areworking to take action to
protect health from extreme heat. Efforts include opening cooling centres, providing extreme heat
health messaging to communities and working to support the most vulnerable.
• Canadian Institutes of Health Research established the Canadian Lyme Disease Research
Network and issued research grants for multidisciplinary research in the area of food security and
climate change in the Canadian North.
• PHAC’s Infectious Disease and Climate Change Program focusses on preparing for andprotecting
Canadians from climate-driven infectious diseases that are zoonotic, food-borne or water-borne. The
Program supports actions on surveillance and monitoring, risk assessments, modelling, laboratory
diagnostics, as well as health professional education and public awareness activities.
• As part of the program, the Infectious Disease and Climate Change Fund (grants and
contributions) was launched in 2017 and invests in monitoring/surveillance and health professional
education and public awareness activities ($2M annually and 34 projects to date). The Program and
Fund also helps, in part, to advance work under the Federal Framework on Lyme Disease and Action
Plan.
• PHAC also received $800K dedicated to the Métis Nation for climate change and health
activities. PHAC has been working with the Métis National Council and Governing Members since August
2017 to facilitate the implementation of the dedicated funding. These projects explore how climate
change impacts health and well-being, identify best practices to adapt, and explore future programming
and resource gaps.
• Indigenous Service Canada’s Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program has funded 241
health adaptation projects across 182 First Nations and Inuit communities since 2008, supporting the
development of solutions to climate change impacts at a community and regional level.
Canada’s first National Adaptation Strategy
In December 2020, as part of its strengthened climate plan, A Healthy Environment and a Healthy
Economy, the Governmentof Canada committed to developing Canada’s first National Adaptation
Strategy with provincial, territorial and municipal governments, Indigenous Peoples, and other key
partners. The strategy will establish a shared vision for climate resilience in Canada,identify key
priorities for increased collaboration, and establish a framework for measuring progress at the national
level under these themes:
1. Health and Well-being (led by Health Canada)
2. Resilient Natural and Built Infrastructure (led by Infrastructure Canada)
3. Thriving Natural Environment (led by Environment and Climate Change Canada)
4. Strong and Resilient Economy (led by Natural Resource Canada) and,
5. Disaster Resilience and Security (led by Public Safety Canada)
Findings from the Health ofCanadians in a Changing Climate report will help information development
of the Health and Well-being component of the National Adaptation Strategy, which is aimed to be
completed by the end of 2022.

Support for the Mental Health Needs of Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including health care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and
Métis, and Black and other racialized Canadians.
• $50 million over two years,starting in 2021-22, to support projects to address posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canadais investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mentalhealth and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of more than $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As part of this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
Promoting Mental Health and Preventing Mental Illness
Through the Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Mental Health Promotion Innovation Fund, the
Government of Canada is investing $39 million from 2019-2028 to address multiple risk and protective
factors to promote mental health for children, youth, young adults and populations susceptible to
mental health inequities (e.g., low-income families, immigrants and refugees, First Nations, Inuit, Métis,
LGBTQ2+, people living with disabilities and people with other socio-economic risk factors).
On March 29, 2020, the Prime Minister announced an investment of $7.5 million to Kids Help Phone to
provide crisis supports for children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.
$9 million is being provided to the United Way (through New Horizons) for practical services for seniors.
The Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund is investing $10 million to support
community-based projects across Canada.
In addition, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement announced a $50 million investment to bolster the
capacity of distress centres, which are experiencing a surge in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic.
PHAC is administering an initialround of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021. A portion of
funds will support an additional round of grants in fiscal year 2021-22. In addition, $2 million of this
funding will support the development of resources to assist distress centres in meeting the needs of
diverse and vulnerable populations.
Mobilizing Data and Evidence
Between 2015-16 and 2019-20, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) invested over $333
million in mental health and behavioural disorders research. Thisrepresents more than 1700 projects
led by experts across the country.
CIHR is also leading the COVID-19 and Mental Health Research Initiative (CMH) in collaboration with
PHAC and Health Canada. This initiative currently supports 101 research projects, representing a total
investment of $13.5 million from CIHR and partners. This work is guided by an Expert Advisory Panel
composed of leading Canadian experts in mental health and substance use. New knowledge generated
through these projects will be mobilized to ensure it will inform policy making in a timely manner.
CIHR provided the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse with a $1 million directed grant to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providersin light
of COVID-19. This includes the creation of six national guidance documents and a rapid assessment of
the challenges faced by people who use drugs during the COVID-19 crisis to guide future policy
decisions.
Statistics Canada developed and administers a web panel survey, the “Canadian Perspectives Survey
Series”. Each month, approximately 4,600 people in the 10 provinces have been responding to the new
iteration of the survey. In addition, in collaboration with Statistics Canada, PHAC funded two cycles of
data for the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health to better understand the wider impacts of the
pandemic on mental health in Canada. A special collection of research articles based on the first cycle of
data was released in the Health Promotion andChronic Disease Prevention Journal on September 27,
2021. The Canadian Community Health Survey also resumed in September 2020. The Canadian
Community Health Survey provides data on a variety of mental health indicators, and has been collected
for many years prior to the pandemic. It will allow for ongoing measurement of changes in mental
health of the Canadian population as the pandemic continues and as Canada recovers.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years inthe Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association and Crisis Services Canada. By 2023,
this service will provide people across Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from
trained responders, using the technology of their choice (voice, text or chat). The Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focused on raising public awareness, reducing
stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and evidence-based
practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned
for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the Government of Canada
to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously supported by
parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan that aligns
with the Framework.
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
Pursuant to the Federal Framework on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Act, Canada’s first Federal
Framework on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was tabled in Parliament on January 22, 2020 and
made public on February 13, 2020. To inform the development of the Framework, in accordance with
the Act, the Minister of Health convened a National Conference on PTSD in April 2019 with the Ministers
of National Defence, Veterans Affairs, and Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, partners and
stakeholders, including people with lived-experience. The Government of Canada is now working with
partners on the implementation of the Framework. The Act requires the Public Health Agency of Canada
to report on the effectiveness of the Framework within five years of its release (by February 2025).
HC’s 2020-21 Departmental Results Report
Health Canada advanced the development of national standards for access to mental health services to
gain insight on practical approaches to developing and implementing these standards. As part of this
work, Health Canada has entered into an agreement with the Standards Council of Canada to lead the
development of standards in the following priority areas, in alignment with the Common Statement of
Principles on Shared Health Priorities developed by federal, provincial and territorial governments:
• Children and youth:
o Integrated Youth Services: increase access to youth mental health and substance use supports
that are integrated with physical health, sexual health and social services
• Primary Health Services Integration:
o Primary Care Integration: increase access to quality, integrated mental health and substance use
supports in primary care settings
o Digital Mental Health and Substance Use Apps: improve access to high-quality, safe and
effective apps to help Canadians make better-informed app choices
• People with complex needs:
o Substance Use Treatment Centres: improve access to high-quality, evidence-based care and
promote an integrated and coordinated treatment system
o Substances Use Workforce: increase substance use workforce capacity to provide evidence-
based care and stepped-care approaches
o Integrated Services for Complex Health Needs: improve integrated treatment approaches for
individuals with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders and complex health needs

core institutions, including those that provide mental health and substance use health supports to
youth.
• This is why we are supporting culturally focused and community based projects that improve
mental health for diverse children and youth, including LGBTQ2S+, Black and Indigenous youth, and
newcomer populations as well as their caregivers.
• Going forward we will continue to collaborate with various communities, and actively seek out
diverse views of youth in these communities.
IF PRESSED ON SUBSTANCE/OPIOID USE IN YOUTH
• Substance use prevention in youth is an important priority for the Government ofCanada.
• We know that the pandemic has exacerbated mental health and substanceuse concerns for
young people.
• That is why the Government of Canada continues to invest in helping youth understand the risks
associated with alcohol, cannabis, tobacco and vaping use. We have also invested in the Know More
Tour to engage teens and young adults on the facts surrounding the overdose crisis and health risks
associated with opioid use.
BACKGROUND
Mental ill health/issues can impact any population and children and youth are no exception. In fact, as
many as two thirds of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25. It is estimated that mental
health issues affect over 800,000 Canadian children and youth annually.
Youth disproportionately visit the Emergency Department (ED) seeking mental health/substance use
services. For example, between 2008-2009 and 2018-19 there was a 61% increase in visits made by
youth to the ED for such services. During this time, hospitalizations for mental health disorders also
increased by 60%.
Twenty four percent (24%) of post-secondary students surveyed in 2019-20 reported using pain
relievers that contain at least one opioid in the past twelve months. Of those, 23% reported problematic
use, which is defined as use for purposes other than prescribed.
Of the 3,515 people who died of an apparent opioid toxicity between January and June 2021, 2% were
aged 0-19 years, and 6% of the 2,908 opioid-relatedpoisoning hospitalizations in the same time period
were aged 0-19 years.
This cohort is also affected by suicide. In 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death among
individuals aged 15 to 34, behind unintentional injuries. In 2019, among individuals aged 10 to 14 years,
males accounted for 46% of suicide deaths; and among individuals aged 15 to 19 years, males account
for 64% of suicide deaths.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on the mental health of children and youth.
Concernsabout the virus itself have been compounded by impacts on school and routines, social
activities, isolation, and decreased access to services and supports. The pandemic also had an impact on
cannabis use in 2021, particularly among younger age groups. Forty-six percent (46%) of people 16 to 19
years reported using more cannabis in the previous twelve months.
Results from 2020 showed that youth were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health as
compared to older Canadians. While most Canadians were less likely to report excellent or very good
mental health during the COVID-19 period, the difference between 2018 and 2020 was particularly
evident for younger adults. Only 42% of those aged 15 to 24 reported excellent or very good mental
healthduring the pandemic compared to 62% before the pandemic in 2018.
More recent survey results from early 2021 showed that younger Canadians persistently indicate the
highest anxiety and depression of all age groups. For example, almost 30% of 16 to 17 yearolds
reported high levels of anxiety and depression, and one in three reported suicidal ideation in the past
year. Conversely, this group reported a lower incidence of diagnosis of a mental health issue, suggesting
they do not have access to diagnostic services and care.
These findings are consistent with the percentage of youth reporting that their mental health was
“somewhat worse” or “much worse” now compared to before the pandemic-35% in March/April 2021.
Additionally, in a Statistics Canada survey of perceptions of personal safety, 11% of Youth aged 15 to 24
reported that harassment or attacks on the basis of race, ethnicity, or skin colour have increased in their
neighbourhood since the start of the pandemic.
MENTAL HEALTH OF BLACK CANADIANS (73 words)
• Our Government recognizes the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians,
including anti-Black racism and its significant impacts on mental health.
• The Public Health Agencyof Canada launched in 2018 the Promoting Health Equity: Mental
Health of Black Canadians Fund which provides $10 million to support 23 community-based projects
across Canada.
• Our community-based projects will continue to take into account these uniqueneeds
throughout the pandemic and as part of our recovery.
IF PRESSED ONSPECIFIC COMMITMENTS (95 words)
• Recently, our Government was pleased to highlight two of these projects as part of our
commitment.
• The Harriet Tubman Institute at York Universityand the TAIBU Community Health Centre are
each receiving $400,000 in funding from the Public Health Agency of Canada. These projects will study
the experience of Black people in academia and further our understanding of culturally responsive
approaches to mental health issues.
• We will continue to support funding to increase knowledge of the mental health needs of Black
Canadians and to create spaces for knowledge sharing and capacity building within Black communities.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEED FOR RACE-BASED COVID-19 DATA (98 words)
• Our Government understands the need for race-based data to understand and address the
disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black Canadians and otherracialized communities.
• PHAC is engaging with its partners to undertake specialized surveys and enhanced surveillance
activities focused on the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 and the pandemic response on key
populations of interest, including racialized populations.
• Throughout this work, we will continue to prioritize consultation and engagement with Black
Canadians and other racialized communities to inform appropriate data collection, analysis and
dissemination approaches that respect privacy and avoid stigmatization and other potential harms of
race-based data collection.
IF PRESSED ON THE CURRENT EVENTS RELATEDTO ANTI-BLACK RACISM (69 words)
• Our Government recognizes the significant and unique challenges faced by Black Canadians and
other racialized populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• Anti-Blackracism is a public health issue. Racism in all of its forms has deep and long lasting
impacts on health and well-being.
• The Public Health Agency of Canada’s Mental Health of Black Canadians’ Fund aims to improve
social conditions that negatively impactmental health, including experiences of discrimination.
BACKGROUND
Black Canadians experience multiple vulnerabilities related to their mental and physical health, largely
due to underlying socio-economic conditions, including experiences of anti-Black racism. For example,
14% of Black Canadians report their health to be fair or poor, compared to 11% of White Canadians.
Furthermore, 64% of young Black women aged 12-17 report their mental health to be excellent or very
good, compared to 77% of youngWhite women. Positive mental health is also declining among Black
Canadians. In 2019, 66% of Black Canadians reported excellent or very good mental health, a
considerable drop from 74% in 2015.
Looking at the underlying socio-economic conditions, 21% ofBlack Canadians report living in housing
below standards, compared to 8% of White Canadians. Moreover, 33% of Black children aged 0-14 and
27% of Black youth aged 15-24 lived in low-income households, compared to 13% and 12% of White
children and youth, respectively.
Experiences of racial discrimination throughout a lifetime can lead to chronic stress and trauma.
Increased anxiety and social exclusion as a result of the health, economic and social effects of COVID-19
can compound poor mental health outcomes, especially for racialized populations. Findings from a
crowdsource survey indicate that 27.9% of Black Canadians (vs. 22.9% of White Canadians) reported fair
or poor mental health in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 32% of Black
Canadians (vs. 24.2% of White Canadians) reported symptoms consistent with moderate/severe
generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, 37.5% of Black Canadians (vs. 22.1% of White Canadians)
reported a moderate or severe impact of COVID-19 on their ability to meet financial obligations or
essential needs.
Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians Fund
Budget 2018 earmarked $42 million to strengthen multiculturalism and address the challenges faced by
Black Canadians, including $10 millionover five years for the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),
and $9 million over three years for Canadian Heritage. These funds are targeted to enhancing local
community supports for youth at risk, and to developing research in support of more culturally-focused
mental health programs in the Black Canadian community.
In September 2018, PHAC launched the Promoting Health Equity: Mental Health of Black Canadians
Fund, to deliver on the $10 million in Budget 2018 funding. Eight short-term capacity-buildingprojects
and fourteen longer-term implementation projects have been funded. A Knowledge Mobilization
Network facilitated by a Black-led organization is also being supported through the Fund. The eight
short-term projects completed their activities in 2020and one of the longer term implementation
projects ended in September 2021. Projects funded through the Fund generate knowledge, capacity,
and projects that promote mental health and address its determinants for Black Canadians. All funded
projects are led by Black Canadian experts or organizations. Funding recipients have demonstrated great
resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are working to adjust planned activities to be responsive
to the pandemic context.
PHAC has established the Mental Health of Black Canadians Working Group, comprised of 11 multi-
disciplinary experts in research, practice and policy from diverse Black communities across Canada. The
Working Group played an integral role in the selection of projects for funding and will continue to
provide essential guidance on capacity-building and strengthening evidence going forward.
Other Federal Commitments Supporting Black Canadians
Budget 2019 committed $45 million to Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy and an Anti-Racism Secretariat.
The Strategy’s key purpose is to find ways to counter racism in its various forms, with a strong focus on
community-based projects. Budget 2019 also provided $25 million over five years to Employment and
Social Development Canada for projects and capital assistance to celebrate, share knowledge and build
capacity in Canada's vibrant Black Canadian communities. This investment will help stakeholders create
the first national institute for Black Canadians. The Canadian Institute for Persons of African Descent will
work to advance initiatives that impact Black Canadians at a systemic level.
In September 2020, the Government of Canada announced nearly $221 million in partnership with
Canadian financial institutions, including up to nearly $93 million from the Government of Canada over
the next four years, to launch Canada’s first-ever Black Entrepreneurship Program. This program will
help Black business owners and entrepreneurs across the country recover from COVID-19 and grow
their businesses.
In December 2020, the Government of Canada announced a new investment of $40 million to create
200home ownership opportunities across the country for Black Canadians. This is in addition to the
$32.4 million partnership between the Government of Canada and Habitat for Humanity Canada to
create up to 414 new homes across Canada.
In January 2021, the Clerk of the Privy Council issued a Call to Action on Anti-Racism, Equity and
Inclusion in the Federal Public Service. This Call to Action calls on Public Service leaders to advance
employment opportunities for Indigenous, Black and other racialized employees, particularly with
respect to executive positions and to better foster a safe and positive workplace, free of racism,
discrimination and other barriers.
The Canadian Institutes of Health Research are supporting researchers across the country to develop
and implement measures to rapidly detect, manage, and reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This
includes projects that examine social determinants of health, such as social isolation, stigma, racism, and
provide evidence-informed interventions to inform social and public health responses.
Race-Based Data and COVID-related Health Inequities
Anti-Black racism underlies a broad range of socioeconomic inequities facing Black Canadians that
contribute to differences in health outcomes. In the context of COVID-19, for example, Black Canadians
and other racialized people are overrepresented in jobs deemed essential, and are more likely to rely on
public transit to get to these jobs. Experiences of racial discrimination throughout a lifetime can also
directly increase risk for chronic disease, which in turn increases the risk of serious complications from
COVID-19. There is a need for race-based data to understand and address the disproportionate impact
of COVID-19 on Black Canadians and other racialized communities.
In Canada, race-based health data has not generally been collected due to privacy and confidentiality
concerns. Collection of race-based data is largely a provincial/territorial (P/T) matter, implemented by
local health units. Some P/Ts, including Manitoba and Ontario, are moving forward on efforts to collect
race-based data. Federally, the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health includes a question about
ethnicity/race. Several analyses are planned that will include this variable to further understand the
impact of the pandemic.
PHAC and partners are undertaking a number of activities to improve Canada’s knowledge of the impact
of COVID-19 on racialized communities, including:
• Reviews of the published literature on race and COVID-19;
• Coordinating with federal and P/T governments to include race/ethnicity as a key variable within
the national data set for COVID-19;
• Engaging with various partners to undertake specialized surveys and enhanced surveillance
activities focused on the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 and the pandemic response on key
populations of interest, including racialized populations; and
• Coordinating with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on efforts to facilitate research
activities related to burden and impact of COVID-19 among racialized and marginalized communities, to
further enhance and expand the knowledge base.
Throughout this work, we will continue to prioritize consultation and engagement with Black Canadians
and other racialized communities to inform appropriate data collection, analysis and dissemination
approaches that respect privacy and avoid stigmatization and other potential harms of race-based data
collection.
PHAC, Health Canada and Statistics Canada are exploring opportunities to increase understanding of the
intersection of health, demographic and socio-economic factors in the context of the pandemic. In
September 2020, PHAC released a new resource entitled “Social determinants and inequities in health
for Black Canadians: A Snapshot”. The Snapshotreports national data on inequalities in health outcomes
and determinants of health for Black Canadians, and highlights how anti-Black racism and systemic
discrimination are key drivers of health and social inequities faced by diverse Black Canadian
communities.

and Inuktitut.
BACKGROUND
2021 MANDATE COMMITMENTS
October 26, 2021, the Prime Minister appointed Dr. Carolyn Bennett as the First Minister of Mental
Health and Addictions. The Prime Minister released mandate letters on December 16, 2021, which
outline the objectives that each minister will work to accomplish, as well as pressing challenges they will
address in their role. The new Minister of Mental Health and Addictions has been mandated to ensure
that mental health care is treated as a full and equal part of our universal health care system, working in
close collaboration with provinces and territories, and lead a whole-of-society approach to address
problematic substance use in Canada.
To realize these objectives, Minister Bennett will deliver in the following commitments:
• Work with the Minister of Health, and with the support of the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Finance, to establish a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer to help expand
the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
• Support the mental health of Canadians by developing and implement a comprehensive,
evidence-based plan, leveraging existing and new investments, including to:
o Develop mental health standards, with a particular focus on health equity;
o Sustain improved access to virtual mental health services with Wellness Together Canada;
o Ensure timely access to perinatal mental health services;
o Implement a three-digitsuicide prevention hotline; and
o Introduce a new fund for student mental health that will support the hiring of new mental
health care counsellors, improve wait times for services, increase access overall and enable targeted
supports to Black and racialized students at post-secondary institutions across Canada.
• Support the Minister of Indigenous Services to co-develop and invest in a distinctions-based
Mental Health and Wellness Strategy to meet the needs of First Nations, Inuit and the Métis Nation,
including culturally appropriate wraparound services for addiction and trauma, suicide and life
promotion and the building of treatment centres.
• Oversee the implementation of our investments in mental health interventions and supports for
people disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, including health care workers, front-line workers,
seniors, Indigenous people, and Black and racialized Canadians.
• Work with the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister for Women
and Gender Equality and Youth to ensure mental health supports are accessible to children and youth as
they recover from the impact of the pandemic.
• Advance a comprehensive strategy to address problematic substance use in Canada, supporting
efforts to improve public education to reduce stigma, and supporting provinces and territories and
working with Indigenous communities to provide access to a full range of evidence-based treatment and
harm reduction, as well as to create standards for substance use treatment programs.
• Require tobacco manufacturers to pay for the cost of federal public health investments in
tobacco control.
• Support the Minister of Public Safety to continue advancing Canada’s first-ever National Action
Plan on Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries, includingadditional investment to support the health and well-
being of first responders.
• Support the Minister of Veterans Affairs to ensure Canadian Armed Forces members and
Veterans have access to adequate mental health resources, services and training programstailored to
their specific needs.
• With the support of the Minister of Rural Economic Development, explore pathways to increase
the accessibility of mental health services in rural areas.
Pressure on Existing Provincial/Territorial Mental Health Services
With Canadians physical distancing and isolated, there is an unprecedented need for virtual services,
such as telehealth and other information lines (e.g., 811), and provinces/territories are not able to
absorb the increased demand.
It is critical thatCanadians have access to effective tools to self-monitor, promote their mental well-
being, obtain credible and reliable information, and access services when deemed necessary. Canadians
need to be re-assured that there are supports available to help alleviate their stress, fear and anxiety.
Canada Mental Health Transfer
The Government has provided funding to provinces and territories, community-based organizations and
used a range of federal levers to improve access to mental health services for Canadians. The
Government committed to implement a new Canada Mental Health Transfer (CMHT)–which would
provide a permanent, stable, and sustainable source(s) of funding to provinces and territories, dedicated
to mental health services. Currently, provinces andterritories are receiving $5 billion over ten years to
support improvements in mental health services through bilateral agreements. Provinces and territories
can use the Canada Health Transfer to cover the costs of medically-necessary health services in their
jurisdiction, which can include mental health services. A new Canada Mental Health Transfer would help
to reduce the strain on other areas of the health care system and expand access to mental health
services for Canadians, particularly for individuals who experience marginalization and/or face barriers
to accessing care.

Health Canada has invested $130 million over two years in Wellness Together Canada, an online mental
health and substance use support portal. Launched in April 2020, Wellness Together Canada provides
free and confidential online mental health and substance use supports accessible 24/7 to individuals
across Canada in both official languages. Interpretation services are also available during phone sessions
in over 200 languages and dialects. Through Wellness Together Canada, individuals in all provinces and
territories have immediate access to supports ranging from self-assessment, educational content and
self-guided programming, to peer support and confidential sessions with social workers, psychologists
and other professionals. Supports are provided online as well as byphone and text for those without
internet access. There are dedicated text lines for youth, adults and front line workers that provide
immediate access to support. There is also a dedicated phone line for accessing Program Navigators that
can assist withfinding resources on the portal. Wellness Together Canada augments existing provincial
and territorial services, and does not replace them.
Wellness Together Canada is led by a consortium of three organizations:
• Stepped Care Solutions is aninterdisciplinary and cross-sector team of clinician-researchers,
leaders and pioneers in the areas of Stepped Care 2.0 and e-mental health.
• Kids Help Phone is Canada’s only 24/7 national service offering support to young people via
phone, text and livechat, and is a global leader in developing and delivering virtual mental health
solutions.
• Homewood Health is a Canadian leader in the development and delivery of national, evidence-
based mental health, trauma, and addiction treatment and services.
National Standards for Mental Health and Substance Use
To fulfill commitments made in the Minister of Health’s mandate letter, the Government of Canada will
“set national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get fast access to the
support they need, when they need it”. Through Budget 2021, the government has allocated $45 million
over two years, starting in 2021-22, to help develop national standards for mental health, in
collaboration with provinces and territories, health organizations, and key stakeholders, so that
Canadians can access timely care, treatment, and support. This language was interpreted broadly to
include standards for substance use due to its close relationship with mental health. Health Canada has
established a memorandum of agreement with the Standards Council of Canada to work with
stakeholders to develop six early national standards deliverables in priority areas. This process is
expected to be launched in early March 2022.
Support for the Mental Health Needsof Those Most Affected by COVID-19
Budget 2021 provides support for populations most affected by COVID-19 in dealing with mental health
challenges. The government will provide:
• $100 million over three years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects that promote mental
health and prevent mental illness in populations disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including health care workers, front-line workers, youth, seniors, First Nations, Inuit and
Métis, and Black and other racialized Canadians.
• $50 million over two years, starting in 2021-22, to support projects to address posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma in frontline workers and others who are most affected by the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Funding to Provincial and Territorial Governments
The Government of Canada is investing $5 billion over ten years to improve Canadians’ access to mental
health services. The investment is being provided directly to provinces and territories via negotiated
bilateral agreements to help them expand access to community-based mental health and addiction
services for children and youth, integrated services for people with complex needs, and spread proven
models of community mental health care and culturally appropriate interventions linked to primary
health services.
In addition, on July 16, the Prime Minister announced a federal investment of more than $19 billion to
help provinces and territories safely restart their economies and make our country more resilient to
possible future waves of the virus. As part of this investment $500 million targeted immediate mental
health and substance service needs, including strengthening the service infrastructure (workforce,
targeted programs) to manage post-pandemic demands that have been exacerbated due to the
pandemic by providing wrap-around care, harm reduction and evidence-based treatment services and
programs.
Suicide Prevention
The Government of Canada is investing $21 million over five years in the Centre for Addiction and
Mental Health (CAMH) to implement and sustain a fully operational pan-Canadian suicide prevention
service in partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association and Crisis Services Canada. By 2023,
this service will provide people across Canada with access to 24/7/365 bilingual crisis support from
trained responders, using the technology of their choice (voice, text or chat). The Federal Framework for
Suicide Prevention was released November 2016. It focused on raising public awareness, reducing
stigma, disseminating information and data, and promoting the use of research and evidence-based
practices. Progress Reports on the Framework are available onCanada.ca, with the next report planned
for release in December 2022. In response to motion M-174, which called on the Government ofCanada
to establish a national suicide prevention action plan and was unanimously supported by
parliamentarians in 2019, the Public Health Agency of Canada is developing an action plan that aligns
with the Framework.
PERINATAL MENTALHEALTH (83 words)
• Our Government is committed to promoting the mental health and wellbeing of mothers and
children.
• We have made significant investments in programs that support the mental health of pregnant
and postpartum individuals, including funding for improving community-level access to supports, and
$26.5 million annually for the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP), which serves 236 projectswith
over 45,000 participants.
• Through such investments and the development of health promotion resources, we are
ensuring timely access to perinatal mental health services, when and where needed.
IF PRESSED ON 2021MANDATE COMMITMENTS (72 words)
• As the first Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, my mandate is to ensure that mental
health careis treated as a full and equal part of our universal health care system, working in close
collaboration with provinces and territories, and to lead a whole-of-society approach to address
problematic substance use in Canada.
• To realize these objectives,I will deliver on several commitments, including ensuring timely
access to perinatal mental health services.
BACKGROUND
The perinatal period includes both pregnancy and the postpartum period. Perinatal mental health is a
state of well-being in which apregnant or postpartum person realizes their own abilities, can cope with
the normal stresses of life and work productively, care for themselves and their newborn, and is able to
make a contribution to their community and society.
Perinatal mental illness refers to mental health conditions experienced “around” pregnancy. This
includes pre-existing mental health conditions, but can also refer to new or different mental health
concerns arising around this period.
Maternal stress, anxiety and depression are significant public health issues, increasing the risk of poor
mental and physical health outcomes for mothers along with potential impacts for children and families.
Maternal deaths with a mental health component, by suicide or drug toxicity, are increasingly
recognized as making up a significant proportion of all maternal deaths.
In recent years, some stakeholders have called for greater federal action in the area of perinatal mental
health. On May 13, 2020, the citizens of Canada brought forward a petition to create a national perinatal
mental health strategy that would provide direction, policy, and funding to develop specialized,
comprehensive perinatal mental health care services. This includes universal screening and timely access
to treatment for all people during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
On May 5, 2021 (World Maternal Mental Health Day), various MP’s offices sent a request to the former
Minister of Health’s Office on behalf of their constituents regarding a National Perinatal MentalHealth
Strategy. This Motion was brought forward by MP Heather McPherson (Edmonton-Strathcona).
On June 3, 2021, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway) put forward Bill C-306, which calls for a National
Perinatal Mental Health Strategy that includes mental health screening and treatment services during
the full perinatal period. This Bill died on the order paper when Parliament was dissolved in August
2021.
Perinatal Surveillance
The Public Health Agency of Canada’s (PHAC) Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System monitors and
reports on maternal, fetal and infant health determinants and outcomes while conducting targeted
epidemiological research to address emerging issues. This program has focused largely on indicators of
physical health, some of which can be associated with maternal mental health (e.g., fetal/infant
mortality, maternal chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol use during pregnancy). However, formal
indicators concerning risk and protective factors for maternal mental health have yet to be established,
as there are presently no routine national sources of data on maternal mental health or maternal access
to/use of mental health services.
PHAC Policy and Program Activities
The Health Portfolio undertakes a number of activities to promote maternaland child health, which
includes supporting positive maternal mental health during the perinatal periods. PHAC makes
significant investments to support perinatal mental health through programs aimed at improving
community-level access to supports for prenatal and recently postpartum women, new parents and
young children facing health inequities. In particular, the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program provides
$26.5 million annually to improve the health of at-risk pregnant individuals, with a focus on mental
health, nutrition, and the promotion of positive health behaviours during pregnancy. Through 236
funded projects, the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program serves more than 45,000 participants across
Canada each year.
PHAC also supports the development of several resources promoting the positive mental health of
pregnant individuals. These resources provide guidance and advice for both healthcare professionals
and individuals that may face poor mental health during the perinatal period, including Family-Centred
Maternity and Newborn Care National Guidelines; the Mothers’ Mental Health Toolkit; and the guidance
document ‘Your Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy’.
To provide rapid support for new parents during the COVID-19 pandemic, Health Canada and PHAC have
recentlydeveloped resources to support the mental health of those who are expecting or who have
recently had a baby.
SUICIDE PREVENTION
Issue
Suicide is a significant public health issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds across Canada.
TheCanada Suicide Prevention Service currently provides people across Canada with suicide crisis
support from trained responders via phone, in English and French, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Key Facts
• In 2019, suicide was the 9th leading cause ofdeath among all Canadians, and the 2nd leading
cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 34, behind unintentional injuries (Statistics Canada).
• Between 2017 and 2019, there were approximately 4,500 deaths by suicide per year in Canada.
This is equivalent to 12 suicide deaths, on average, every day.
• The Public Health Agency of Canada is supporting the implementation of a fully operational pan-
Canadian suicide prevention service, which provides 24/7 toll-free crisis support.
Key Messages
• The Government of Canada recognizes the importance for all Canadians to have access to
critical mental health resources and suicide prevention services.
• Budget 2019 announced $25 million over five years, starting in 2019–20, with $5 million per
year ongoing, to develop and sustain a pan-Canadian suicide prevention service, in order to provide
people across Canada with access to bilingual, 24/7, crisis support from trained responders, using the
technology of their choice: voice, text or chat.
• The Canada Suicide Prevention Service currently makes available suicide crisis support over the
phone to anyone in Canada, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
• The Government of Canada also supports the implementation of a three-digit number for
suicide prevention that is easier to remember and therefore improves access to crisis support for people
across Canada.
If pressed on timing for the Implementation of a three-Digit Number for Suicide Prevention Crisis
Support
• The Government of Canada is closely following the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission proceeding which will help determine the timing and resources
necessary for implementing a three-digit suicide prevention number.
• Launched in summer 2021, the public consultation will build a comprehensive public record
about implementing a three-digit suicide prevention number in Canada. The public consultation
reopened on November 30, 2021 and closed on January 31, 2022.
• This record will help the Commission determine the need for a three-digit number. It will also
help identify barriers, and should any be identified, determine how best to address them.
If Pressed on COVID-19 Mental HealthCrisis Supports
• The Government is providing over $14.8 million over 36 months to Kids Help Phone to provide
crisis supports for children and youth during the pandemic.
• In addition to investments in suicide crisis services, the 2020 Fall Economic Statement
announced a $50 million investment to bolster the capacity of distress centres across the country, which
are experiencing a surge in demand for crisis support during the COVID-19 pandemic.
• The Public Health Agency of Canada is also providing additional funding for the Canada Suicide
Prevention Service to support the increased demand for crisis support at this time.
Background
Between 2017 and 2019, there were approximately 4,500 deaths by suicide per year in Canada, which is
equivalent to 12 people dying by suicide every day. In 2019 suicide was the 9th leading cause of death
among all Canadians, and the 2nd leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 34, behind
unintentional injuries. According to preliminary data, there were 3,839 deathsby suicide reported in
2020. The 2020 data is provisional and incomplete, and could potentially increase by 5 to 15% over the
next year. This delay is due to the length of time that coroners and medical examiners sometimes
require to complete their investigations. At this time, caution should be used to arrive at any conclusions
regarding suicide trends during the pandemic (Statistics Canada). There is no single cause that fully
explains or predicts suicide; a combination of factors are associated with suicide, such as mental illness,
physical health, personal issues and loss, childhood abuse and neglect, and exposure to trauma.
Three-Digit Number for Suicide Prevention
In the Minister of Mental Health and Addiction’s Mandate Letter, the Prime Minister asksthe Minister
to deliver on the commitment of implementing a three-digit suicide prevention number.
It is expected that the implementation of a three-digit number for suicide crisis will build upon the
Government’s current support of the existing pan-Canadian suicide prevention service. The Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is investing $21 million over 5 years ($4.2 million per year) for the
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), with their partners, to implement and sustain this
service. In addition, $800,000 per year is allocated to PHAC to cover the oversight, administration,
reporting and evaluation activities associated with the Contribution Agreement with CAMH.
The Canada Suicide Prevention Service currently provides people across Canada with suicide crisis
support from trained responders via phone (1-833-456-4566), in English and French, 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Calls to the service are answered by trained responders from a network of 11
community-based distress centres across Canada and a back-up hub of responders.
On December 11, 2020, parliamentarians voted unanimously in favour of a motion sponsored by MP
Todd Doherty (Conservative, British Columbia) calling on the federal government to act immediately to
set up a national 988number to consolidate all existing suicide crisis numbers.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) is responsible for
establishing any three digit abbreviated codes. The CRTC launched a regulatory proceeding on June 3,
2021to consult on a proposed three-digit hotline. The public consultation closed on September 1, 2021,
resulting in 247 interventions submitted by stakeholders and members of the general public. These
interventions are currently available online, and parties were able to file replies to these interventions
before October 1, 2021. Following a petition from stakeholders representing persons with disabilities,
the CRTC reopened the consultation in November 2021 to allow for new interventions in accessible
formats,such as video. The public consultation closed on January 31, 2022. These interventions and
replies will become part of the public record that the Commission will examine to make its
determinations. The CRTC is unable to comment on anticipated timelines for releasing these
determinations. As highlighted in Budget 2021, the government is committed to ensuring funds are
available to support the creation of this three-digit number.
COVID-19 Mental Health Crisis Supports: Through the 2020 Fall Economic Statement, the Government of
Canada announced a $50 million investment to bolster the capacity of distress centres. PHAC is
administering an initial round of grants to 57 distress centres in winter/spring 2021-22. A second
solicitation closed on October 6, 2021 for recipients with remaining or emerging needs and for eligible
organizations not included in the first round of funding. Funding approval for successful applicants is
being finalized. In addition, $2 million of this funding is supporting the development ofresources to
assist distress centres in meeting the needs of diverse and vulnerable populations.
Motion 174–A National Suicide Prevention Action Plan: In April 2018, MP Charlie Angus (NDP, Timmins-
James Bay) sponsored motion M-174, calling for the Government to establish a national suicide
prevention action plan. On May 8, 2019, parliamentarians voted unanimously in favour of M-174,
though it is non-binding. The proposed actions in the plan are aligned with the Framework. The Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) will facilitate coordination and collaboration on elements of the action
plan with relevant departments, agencies and key stakeholders through its convening role on the
Framework. An update on M-174 was included in the December 2020 Progress Report on the Federal
Framework for Suicide Prevention. Efforts to develop the Action Plan will be included in the December
2022 Progress Report as part of legislated reporting of the Federal Framework for Suicide Prevention.
Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health and Survey on Mental Health and Stressful Events: PHAC is
currently conducting surveillance to understand the impact of COVID-19 on suicide and self-harm. The
2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health has shown that during the early stage of the pandemic, the
percentage of Canadians reporting suicide ideation since the pandemic began was not significantly
different from the percentage reporting in 2019. Risk factors of reporting suicide ideation during the
pandemic included being under 65, Canadian-born,a frontline worker, reporting pandemic-related
income/job loss or loneliness/isolation, experiencing a highly stressful/traumatic event during one's
lifetime, and having lower household income and educational attainment. Continued surveillance of
suicideand risk/protective factors is needed to inform suicide prevention efforts.
CIHR-FUNDED MENTAL HEALTH ANDADDICTIONS RESEARCH (118 words)
• Our government continues to recognize the importance of funding innovative and timely
research that willimprove health outcomes for people experiencing challenges related to mental health
and substance use.
• That is why, over the last five years, through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, we
have invested over $413 million in mental health and behavioural disorders research and over $146
million in research on addictions.
• This includes investments of $13.5 million in the COVID-19 and Mental Health Initiative,
supporting research to provide timely evidence to decision makers on mental health andsubstance use
responses in the context of COVID-19.
• Additionally, in Budget 2021, we committed $45 million over two years to develop evidence-
informed national mental health service standards.
BACKGROUND
Mental Health
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, CIHR invested over $413 million in mental health and behavioural
disorders research. This represents more than 1700 projects led by experts across the country.
For example, CIHR, in partnership with the Graham Boeckh Foundation, is supporting ACCESS Open
Minds, a national project that is transforming the way youth aged 11-25 access mental health care by
developing and testing evidence-informed approaches. There are currently 17 sites operating in 7
provinces and one territory. These sites have transformed youth mental health services in diverse ways
based on local context. For example, in Ulukhaktok, a remote community in the Northwest Territories
where professional service providers are not always available, the site is evaluating a model where lay
health workers are trained to provide support to youth in distress.
Between 2016-17 and 2020-21, CIHR invested over $23 million dollars in research related to suicide
prevention. This research will lead to the discovery of new, effective solutions for better prevention.
The impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, substance use, and addiction are also being measured,
offering new evidence-based treatments and services to all Canadians. Recent findings identified that
substance use is increasing during COVID-19, and that treatment disruptions can cause relapse,
withdrawal and the restart of risky injection behaviours. While caregivers themselves and older
Canadians require additional supports.
COVID-19 and Mental Health Initiative (CMH)
The mental health of Canadians has worsened during the pandemic. In April 2020, CIHR launched the
CMH initiative to provide timely evidence to decision makers on mental health and substance use
responses in the context of COVID-19. CIHR launched four funding opportunities under this initiative,
supporting a total of 101 projects for a total investment of $13.7M from CIHR and partners, including:
• Rapid synthesis and knowledge-to-action funding opportunity for current evidence on mental
health service needs, delivery and guidelines, practice and related issues, in the COVID-19 context.
• $1M directed grant to the Canadian Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM) to
undertake urgent activities to support people who use drugs, decision-makers and care providers in light
of COVID-19.
• COVID-19 Mental Health & Substance Use Service Needs and Delivery funding opportunity to
advance research on understanding rapid system transformations, developing innovative adaptations of
services and/or delivery and matching access to service with needs.
• $191K to four CMH grantees to accelerate rapid research related to emerging SARS-CoV-2
variants and generate timely evidence relevant to biological, clinical, health system, and public health
strategies.
Budget 2021
Highlights with respect to mental health research and services from Budget 2021 include:
• $45 million/2 years, starting in 2021-22, to Health Canada, PHAC, and CIHR to help develop
national mental health service standards, in collaboration with provinces and territories, health
organizations, and key stakeholders.
Substance Use
CIHR supports researchers across Canada that aim to address various issues related to substance use
and has invested more than $146 in the area between 2016-17 and 2020-201.
In 2014, CIHR established a nationalresearch network in problematic substance use called the Canadian
Research Initiative in Substance Misuse (CRISM). CRISM is composed of four large regional nodes (British
Columbia, Prairies, Ontario, Québec/Atlantic) that connect researchers, service providers, decision
makers and people with lived experience from across Canada. CRISM is recognized as a critical network
that responds to the policy and evidence needs of decision-makers. CRISM activities include:
• The OPTIMA Study (2016-ongoing)–a national multi-site clinical trial involving over 270
participants recruited from all four CRISM Nodes to compare and evaluate two models of care for the
treatment of opioid use disorder. (~$4.4 million over 4 years).
• National Treatment Guideline–CRISM has developed a National Guideline for the clinical
management of opioid use disorder, which was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal
on March 5, 2018.
• Implementation Research Program–On September 14, 2017, CIHR announced a new
investment of $7.5 million over six years for CRISM to conduct a national research program for effective
implementation of evidence-based interventions into clinical and community.
On April 16, 2021, CIHR launched CRISM Phase II: Regional Nodes funding opportunity. This funding
opportunity represents a total investment of $17M over 6 years, beginning in 2022-2023, and looks to
build and expand on the successes of the Initiative’s first phase by increasing the number of Regional
Nodes to enhance geographic coverage while maintaining the “Network of Networks” and expanding
capacity.
In addition to priority-driven investments to CRISM, CIHR also invested $1.5 million to support
evaluation of interventions implemented across Canada in response to the opioid crisis throughthe
Evaluation of Interventions to Address the Opioid Crisis Funding Opportunity.
In March 2020, CIHR supported 7 projects on methamphetamine and related psychostimulant use,
totaling $700,000. This funding supports research in diverse areas including effectiveness of existing
treatment options, harm reduction strategies, sociocultural impacts of methamphetamine use and
epidemiology of methamphetamine use and associated disorders.
In March 2022, CIHR announced $2M in funding to support 20 one-year catalystgrants on alcohol. These
projects will strengthen the evidence base and expand alcohol research in key areas, foster alcohol-
related research capacity, and inform the development of future larger scale research projects.
Best Brain Exchange (BBE)
In November 2020, CIHR hosted the ‘Innovations in Virtual Care for Mental Health and Substance Use’
BBE in collaboration with the British Columbia Ministry of Health, British Columbia Ministry of Mental
Health and Addictions, and Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. This BBE brought together
provincial policy and decision makers, researchers and implementation experts, non-governmental
organizations and other key stakeholders to gain an understanding of how virtual care can meet the
unique and evolving mental health and substance use service needs of British Columbia’s diverse
population during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONSIDERATIONS
• The Prime Minister released the new mandate letters on December 16, 2021. The Minister of
Health’s mandate letterincluded a commitment to work with the Minister of Mental Health and
Addictions and Associate Minister of Health and with the support of the Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Finance to establish a permanent, ongoing Canada Mental Health Transfer, tohelp expand
the delivery of high-quality, accessible and free mental health services, including for prevention and
treatment.
The Minister of Mental Health and Addictions and Associate Minister of Health’s mandate letter named
many priorities that will support the mental health of Canadians and require timely and high-quality
mental health and substance use research, including:
• Develop mental health standards, with a particular focus on equity;
• Advance a comprehensive strategy to address problematic substance use in Canada, supporting
efforts to improve public education to reduce stigma, and supporting provinces and territories and
working with Indigenous communities to provide access to a full range of evidence-based treatment and
harm reduction, as well as to create standards for substance use treatment programs.
