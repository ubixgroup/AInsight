WHMIS classification Health hazards: Skin Irritation – Category 2 Skin Sensitization: Category 1A Specific Target Organ Toxicity - Single Exposure – Category 3 (Respiratory Tract Irritation) Physical hazards: Flammable Liquids – Category 2 Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Does not meet criteria Median lethal dose (LD50): 7,940 mg/kg (rat)Footnote 1. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral). Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50: > 5,000 mg/kg (rabbit) (based on study summaryFootnote 2). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable MMA is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): Does not meet criteria Median lethal concentration (LC50): 29.8 mg/L (rat, 4 hour)Footnote 3. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation - Vapours). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Category 2 The results from a study conducted similarly to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 404 suggested that MMA may cause moderate to severe skin irritationFootnote 4. In this study, 0.5 mL of MMA was applied to the skin of 2 rabbits for 4 hours. One rabbit did not display signs of erythema or edema but the other rabbit experienced eschar formation and blanching of the skin (along with a 4/4 score for erythema and a 3/4 score for edema at 24 hours). Although this is not a standard guideline compliant study, data are sufficient to meet a Category 2 classification [HPR 8.2.2(3)(b)(iii)]. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Irritation - Category 2 [HPR 8.2.2(3)(b)(iii)]. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Does not meet criteria In a 2-rabbit study, the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour scores for corneal opacity and iritis in both animals were 0/4 and 0/2, respectively. Conjunctival redness scores were 2/3 at 24 hours in both animals but full reversal was achieved by 48 hoursFootnote 4. These scores are not severe enough to meet classification criteria. The available data do not meet classification criteria for Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation. Respiratory Sensitization: Does not meet criteria There are several case studies available that report the presence of asthma and/or respiratory distress after workers were exposed to MMAFootnote 5,Footnote 6,Footnote 7. Johnson and colleagues identified that these cases seem to be associated with “end-user” occupations where the pattern of exposure is characterised by high peak levels of short durationFootnote 7. In these case studies, the bronchial challenge tests were conducted by exposing the volunteers to an atmosphere that mimicked the workplace, rendering it difficult to distinguish whether the effects were from MMA or another workplace substance. The only bronchial challenge test that was specific to MMA had negative results. Thus, the conclusion by the study authors was that there was insufficient evidence of MMA-induced airway hypersensitivityFootnote 7. The available data do not meet classification criteria for Respiratory Sensitization. Skin Sensitization: Category 1A Multiple human case reports have shown MMA to be a strong skin sensitizer in occupational settingsFootnote 8,Footnote 9,Footnote 10,Footnote 11,Footnote 12,Footnote 13,Footnote 14,Footnote 15. Based on the high frequency of occurrence of sensitization in humans, the available data meet the classification criteria for Category 1A [HPR 8.4.1(4)]. An OECD Guideline 429 (Skin Sensitisation: Local Lymph Node Assay) study in mice (4/group) exposed to 0, 10, 30, 50, 75 or 100% (neat) solutions in acetone reported stimulation indices (SI) of 0, 1.5, 2.3, 2.0, 4.4 and 7.3, respectively, which meet classification criteria for Category 1Footnote 2. Strong positive results were obtained in several other guideline studies, including guinea pig maximization testsFootnote 16,Footnote 17 and in other local lymph node assaysFootnote 2,Footnote 18. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization - Category 1A [HPR 8.4.1(4)]. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In vivo: Negative results were obtained in an inhalation chromosomal aberration test in miceFootnote 2,Footnote 19. In a mouse erythrocyte micronucleus test where mice were exposed to MMA orally, the results were also negative (based on study summaryFootnote 2). There was increased sister chromatid exchange in male workers exposed to MMA, but this was found by the study authors to be unrelated to MMA exposure (based on study summaryFootnote 2). In vitro: An OECD Guideline 471 (Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay) study in S. typhimurium strains TA 1535, TA 97, TA 98 and TA 100 was negative with and without metabolic activationFootnote 2. Another OECD Guideline 471 study in S. typhimurium strains TA 97a, TA 98, TA 100, TA 102 and TA 104 was negative with and without metabolic activationFootnote 2. Several additional studies in various S. typhimurium strains also reported negative genotoxicity resultsFootnote 2. An OECD Guideline 473 (In Vitro Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test) in Chinese hamster ovary cells reported ambiguous results without metabolic activation and weakly positive results with metabolic activationFootnote 2. A pre-guideline mouse lymphoma assay in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells was positive without and inconclusive with metabolic activationFootnote 2. Another mouse lymphoma assay in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells was positive with and negative without metabolic activation, whereas a third study reported ambiguous results without such activationFootnote 2. A pre-guideline in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus test in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts was negative without metabolic activationFootnote 2. An OECD Guideline 479 (Genetic Toxicology: In Vitro Sister Chromatid Exchange Assay in Mammalian Cells) in Chinese hamster ovary cells was ambiguous with and without metabolic activationFootnote 2. Another sister chromatid exchange assay in human lymphocytes was negative for genotoxicityFootnote 2. The available in vivo data do not meet classification criteria. The ambiguous/positive in vitro data are insufficient to evaluate for classification. The available data do not meet classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria MMA has been classified in Group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)Footnote 20. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has classified MMA in Category 4A (not classifiable as a human carcinogen)Footnote 21. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) completed a 2-year inhalation carcinogenicity study and did not find any evidence of carcinogenicity for male rats exposed at 500 or 1,000 ppm MMA or for female rats exposed to 250 or 500 ppm MMA, or for male and female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 500 or 1,000 ppm MMAFootnote 22. In a 2-year rat study, administration of 6, 60, or 2,000 mg/L MMA in drinking water produced no treatment-related tumorsFootnote 20. A skin painting study, which involved the administration of MMA 3 times/week for 4 months, produced no local tumors throughout the duration of the rats’ lifespansFootnote 23. The available data do not meet classification criteria for Carcinogenicity. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria Female rats exposed to MMA via whole-body inhalation of up to 2,028 ppm for 6 hours/day on days 5-15 of gestation showed no embryo toxicity, fetal toxicity, or malformations, even at exposure levels that resulted in maternal toxicityFootnote 2,Footnote 24,Footnote 25. In inhalation studies with doses up to 1,000 ppm in rats and up to 400 ppm in mice, no significant reproductive or developmental effects were notedFootnote 26,Footnote 27. In another mouse inhalation study with a dose of 1,330 ppm, no evidence of fetal toxicity or teratogenic effects was foundFootnote 28. MMA did not demonstrate an effect on male fertility when animals had been exposed to concentrations up to 9,000 ppm in another studyFootnote 29. In another study with limited details available, rats were orally administered 4, 8, 16 or 32% MMA (in water) for 8 months. Seven out of 10 rats to which the MMA was administered at a concentration of 32% showed partial seminal vesicle atrophy. The seminal vesicles in the remaining rats showed normal histology. Testis, epididymis and vas deferens showed normal histology in all ratsFootnote 30. Lower doses had no reproductive effects. Effects at the highest dose are insufficient to meet classification criteria. The available data do not meet classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Category 3 (Respiratory Tract Irritation) Oral Route of Exposure: In an oral toxicity study, rats and rabbits were administered single doses of 8.42, 9.36, 10.30 or 11.23 g/kg (rats), and 0.94, 1.87, 2.81, 3.74, 4.68, 5.8, 6.55, 7.49 or 8.42 g/kg (rabbits) of undiluted MMAFootnote 1. Effects such as an increased respiration rate and motor weakness were only seen at very high lethal doses. Since these effects are associated with mortality, they are not relevant to classification in this hazard class. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available. Inhalation Route of Exposure: In humans: No adverse effects were observed following an acute exposure to 50 ppm MMA except minor irritation in the noseFootnote 31. Another study tested higher concentrations and found that irritation to the respiratory tract occurred among workers exposed to 170 to 248 ppm MMA (based on study summaryFootnote 2). In an area with a spot concentration of 2,300 ppm, workers experienced unbearable discomfort. The study concluded that respiratory tract irritation occurred at concentrations exceeding 100 ppm. In an epidemiological survey, irritation of the eyes and the upper respiratory tract was limited to acute and reversible reactions after short-term peak exposures at concentrations exceeding 100 ppm (based on study summaryFootnote 2). In a study with human volunteers, no effects on cytokine levels that would be indicative of irritation were seen after a 50-ppm exposure to MMAFootnote 32. In animals: Irritation to mucous membranes occurred when animals (rats, guinea pigs and rabbits) were exposed to MMA vapourFootnote 1. Another study exposed rats to 100 ppm MMA and observed interalveolar congestion/hemorrhage, pulmonary vasodilatation, and pulmonary edema after an exposure time of 2 or 4 hoursFootnote 19. A 1-hour exposure time did not cause these same effects. On the other hand, a study conducted by the Methacrylate Producers Association concluded that MMA was not a respiratory irritant in mice at concentrations up to 33,000 ppmFootnote 33. Due to the presence of human respiratory tract irritation that is transient, along with animal data that confirm tissue changes, the available data meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity - Single Exposure – Category 3 (Respiratory Tract Irritation) [HPR 8.8.1(2)]. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: In a 21-day study, rats were fed 500 mg/kg/day of MMAFootnote 34. Compared to controls, behavioral effects, such as a statistically significant decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity and conditioned avoidance response, and a statistically significant increase in aggression, were observed. The study authors stated that no behavioral effects were noted at 100 and 200 mg/kg/day in a previous unpublished study. Dermal Route of Exposure: MMA is widely used in prosthetic dentistry and therefore dental technicians are repeatedly exposed to it in their daily work. There have been multiple reports of peripheral nervous system effects, including feelings of numbness, coldness, and pain in fingers, in humans after handling MMA without glovesFootnote 35,Footnote 36,Footnote 37,Footnote 38. In one case, there was evidence of axonal neuropathy with loss of large myelinated fibers and unmyelinated axons in a 58-year old dental technicianFootnote 38. Despite the many case studies available that demonstrate a correlation between dermal MMA exposure and generalized peripheral neuropathy, a causal relation cannot be confirmed due to the many other chemicals present in a dental work place. An experimental physiologic rat study was available that examined the effects of MMA when dermally applied to the tail skin for 8 weeks (3 hours daily)Footnote 39. It was found that there were reduced amplitudes of the primary response of tail muscles to proximal motor nerve stimulation. However, the dosage applied was not specified. Thus, this study is insufficient for classification purposes. Inhalation Route of Exposure: Increased chronic cough and mild airway obstruction were observed in humans at mean atmospheric concentrations of MMA vapour between 18.5 and 21.6 ppmFootnote 40. At a mean atmospheric MMA concentration of 5.3 ppm, there were no significant clinical symptoms or abnormal hematological or serum biochemical findings, with the exception of some workers complaining of throat irritation and frequent cough and sputaFootnote 41. Details on severity of effects from this study are insufficient for classification. In animals, significant effects, including nasal lesions and lung damage, were seen at MMA vapour exposures of 400 ppm and greater in long-term studies (102 to 104 weeks)Footnote 22, Footnote 42, Footnote 43, Footnote 44. These doses were too high for classification. In a 97-day vapour inhalation study in rats with MMA exposures up to 1,000 ppm, no gross or histopathological changes were observed and no statistically significant differences in mortality or body weights were noted between control and test groupsFootnote 45.
