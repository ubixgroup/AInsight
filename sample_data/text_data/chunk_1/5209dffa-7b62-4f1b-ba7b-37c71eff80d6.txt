The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of tattoo inks and permanent make-up pigments with Sections 16 and 18 of the FDA and other specific requirements of the CR. For this project, compliance of select tattoo inks and permanent make-up pigments with the FDA and CR was determined through a sampling and testing process. Relevant products were sampled from both physical and online establishments by Health Canada inspectors. Compliance with the requirements listed under the FDA and CR was then verified through testing at both of Health Canada's Product Safety Laboratory and Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch Microbiology Laboratory. Prior to initiating inspections, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of tattoo ink and permanent make-up pigment companies in Canada. This effort resulted in a list of companies that included tattoo parlours, retailers, importers, and manufacturers. These companies were provided a letter informing them that tattoo inks and permanent make-up pigments are regulated as cosmetics in Canada and are subject to the requirements of the FDA and its CR. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2022 to 2023 fiscal year, chemical and microbial testing of 30 different products was carried out, where 27 of the 30 samples were imported products. The testing resulted in 3 stop distributions and 23 commitments to address non-compliance. There were 4 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

World Famous World Famous – Dead Sea Canada Tattoo Supply United States of America No compliance issues identified None Disclaimer: Inspectors apply a systematic bias during the selection of establishments and samples. Inspectors do not select products randomly; instead, they select the ones that are more likely not to meet health and safety requirements due to observed characteristics. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, Health Canada does not consider the findings of CV projects to reflect overall market compliance, unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria measured in this project. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
