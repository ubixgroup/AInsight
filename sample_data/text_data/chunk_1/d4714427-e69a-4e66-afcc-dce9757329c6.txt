For that purpose, Health Canada's Consumer Product Safety Program (CPSP) administers and enforces the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act (CCPSA) and its regulations. Danger to human health or safety Health Canada has assessed the hazards associated with the use of USB chargers. These products may pose an electric shock, burn, or fire hazard. Based on the danger to human health or safety assessment, Health Canada has determined that certain USB chargers that do not conform to the applicable criteria set out in CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 62368-1:19 - Audio/video, information and communication technology equipment – Part 1: Safety requirements (Binational standard with UL 62368-1), or the equivalent, pose a danger to human health or safety. Risk mitigation Based on the information currently available, CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 62368-1:19 sets out criteria that may be sufficient to mitigate the risk of electric shock, burn, or fire, including but not limited to: Electric strength test – clause 5.4.9, and Table 25 Drop test – Annex DVE; C22.2 NO. 223-15 clause 6.9 Strain relief and blade retention test – Annex DVE; C22.2 NO. 223-15 clause 6.10 You can find additional details about the scope of products affected and the hazard in the danger to human health or safety assessment. Responsibilities Manufacturers, importers, advertisers and retailers are reminded that: Consumer products that are a danger to human health or safety are prohibited from being manufactured, imported, advertised or sold in Canada according to paragraphs 7(a) and 8(a) of the CCPSA; It is the responsibility of industry to ensure that the products they supply to the Canadian market comply with the CCPSA and its regulations; Conformance with the identified performance criteria does not mean that the products are fully compliant with the CCPSA; Health Canada recognizes that there may be other possible health or safety concerns with the use of these or similar products; Industry should review their products for all potential hazards and respond appropriately to make sure they are safe for consumers; and The CPSP operates as a post-market regulatory regime, meaning that there is no pre-market review or approval of consumer products by Health Canada. Health Canada may take immediate compliance and enforcement actions in line with the Department's compliance and enforcement policy framework when it has reasonable grounds to believe that a consumer product is a danger to human health or safety. Regulated parties that fail to comply voluntarily may be subject to enforcement actions under the CCPSA, which may include seizure, orders to take corrective measures, orders to recall products, administrative monetary penalties, or criminal prosecution. Health Canada will continue to monitor the situation and may update this Notice and the associated Danger to Human Health or Safety Assessment as warranted.
