Notes: This dataset provides the results obtained by Health Canada’s Canadian Radiological Monitoring Network (CRMN) for the gross alpha and beta activity concentrations in drinking water, given in units of becquerels per liter (Bq/L). More information about the CRMN network can be found on the Health Canada website (see link below).   
  
  Although water quality is a matter of provincial jurisdiction, the CRMN, in collaboration with the city of Ottawa, has been conducting a targeted program to monitor the radiological content of drinking water from two water treatment plants in Ottawa, ON. The Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality recommend screening levels of 0.5 Bq/L and 1.0 Bq/L for gross alpha and gross beta activity, respectively. The screening levels are set to reflect the most restrictive Maximum Acceptable Concentrations (MACs) for specific radionuclides in drinking water. If the screening levels are not exceeded, compliance with the guidelines can be inferred. The screening levels set out in the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality are calculated based on annual averages of radionuclides in drinking water. Short-term exposure to levels above those recommended by these guidelines does not indicate a health risk. The measured gross alpha and gross beta activity concentrations presented here are well below the screening levels set by the Guidelines for Canadian Drinking Water Quality, with only one exception to date. This occurred February 28, 2011, and was attributable to the flushing of lead pipes at the water treatment plant. It resulted in a spike of naturally occurring lead radionuclides that was dealt with immediately by the City of Ottawa.   
  
  The map shows the approximate sampling location for each monitoring station. Stations are found within the associated location range.
