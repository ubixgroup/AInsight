The LD50 was 4,400 mg/kg in male rats and 5,200 mg/kg in female rats (based on study summaryFootnote 1). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral). Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50 (rabbit) > 5,000 mg/kgFootnote 1 In an acute dermal toxicity study, New Zealand White rabbits (10 per group) were administered D-limonene at 5,000 mg/kg on clipped abraded abdominal skin using an occlusive patch for 24 hours (based on study summaryFootnote 1). No deaths occurred throughout the 7-day study. Normal body weight gain was observed in all animals. At necropsy, macroscopic examination of main organs showed no abnormalities. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable D-Limonene is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): No data available Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Category 2 Dermal exposure to undiluted D-limonene in 1 human subject caused burning, itching, aching and a purpuric rash. No information on reversibility was provided (allergic reaction cannot be precluded)Footnote 2. In a human patch test study, there was evidence of sensory effects and urticarial responses on removal of the patches and irritation persisted for up to 72 hours in many volunteers. The authors concluded that D-limonene was a skin irritant in humansFootnote 3. In a primary dermal irritation study in animals performed according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 404 and in compliance with good laboratory practice (GLP), the intact skin of the flank of 3 albino rabbits was exposed to 0.5 mL of undiluted D-limonene under a semi-occlusive patch for 4 hoursFootnote 4. Mean individual scores at 24, 48 and 72 hours were, respectively, 2/4, 2/4 and 2/4 for erythema and 1.33/4, 2/4 and 1.33/4 for edema. Signs of erythema and edema, as well as desquamation of the skin surface, were observed in all animals on day 7. In another 4-rabbit study using undiluted D-limonene in compliance with OECD TG 404 and GLP, the mean individual scores for 24, 48 and 72 hours for the respective rabbits for erythema were 2, 2, 1.7 and 2. The mean individual scores for the respective rabbits for edema were 1.3, 0.7, 1.3 and 2Footnote 5. In all of the above animal studies, erythema and edema scores do not meet classification criteria. The available human data meet the classification criteria for Skin Irritation – Category 2. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Does not meet criteria In an eye irritation study conducted according to OECD TG 405 and in compliance with GLP, 3 male New Zealand White rabbits were exposed to 0.1 mL of undiluted D-limonene in one of the eyes while the other eye served as a control (based on study summaryFootnote 4). The eyes were examined for irritation scores at 1 hour and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after dosing. Instillation of D-limonene resulted in slight-to-moderate redness of conjunctivae associated with moderate chemosis in all treated animals after 1 hour of instillation. The irritation completely resolved within 7 days. Mean individual 24-, 48- and 72-hour scores for the 3 animals were all 0 for corneal opacity and iritis; 0.3, 1 and 1.3 for conjunctival redness; and 1, 0.3 and 1 for chemosis. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation. Respiratory Sensitization: No data available Skin Sensitization: Category 1B D-Limonene has been shown to cause skin sensitization in humansFootnote 6Footnote 7. In one study, 7 dermatology patients were exposed to 1% solutions of melaleuca oil or 1% solutions of the constituents comprising this oil. Of the 7 subjects, 6 showed positive sensitization reactions to D-limoneneFootnote 7. In a case report, a 53-year-old scientist presented with patchy dermatitis on his fingers and hands. Patch testing was negative; however, an allergic reaction was noted after exposure to the diluted solvent and DL-limonene (used as an analogue in this study)Footnote 6. In another human patch test study, D-limonene caused strong reactions for all types of patches within 10 to 15 minutes of exposure. The study authors concluded that the test substance was a skin sensitizer in humansFootnote 3. In a Kligman Maximization test, 25 human volunteers were exposed to D-limonene on a skin site pre-treated for 24 hours with 5% aqueous sodium laurel sulfate (SLS). The test substance exposure lasted 48 hours under occlusive conditions. Following a 10-day rest period, a new skin site was washed with 10% SLS for 1 hour after which there was a challenge with an 8% solution of the test substance. A sensitization reaction with D-limonene was not observedFootnote 3. In a local lymph node assay performed in CBA/Ca mice according to OECD TG 429 and in compliance with GLP, D-limonene was applied to groups of mice (4 females per dose) at a concentration of 0, 10, 25, 50, 75 or 100% v/v in ethanol/diethyl phthalate (3:1 v/v) (based on study summaryFootnote 4). The test substance was applied to the dorsal surface of each ear for 3 consecutive days. Stimulation indices for 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100% D-limonene were 1.3, 3.4, 4.0, 8.8 and 6.5, respectively. The estimated concentration giving rise to a 3-fold increase in lymphocyte proliferation (EC3) was 22% v/v (5,500 µg/cm2). No increase in visual levels of irritancy to the ear skin was observed during the study. The results meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitizer - Category 1B, as per HPR 8.4.1(4). D-Limonene also tested positive in the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT)Footnote 8. Intradermal induction was initiated on day 0 with an injection of 0.1 mL of 5% D-limonene, 0.1 mL of 5% D-limonene with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), or 0.1 mL of FCA alone. Each injection was repeated twice. Positive results for sensitization were obtained; however, the number of animals reacting was not provided in the study. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitizer – Category 1B [HPR 8.4.1(4)]. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In vivo: Negative results were reported in a mammalian spot test. Mouse embryos were treated in utero (intraperitoneal administration) with 215 mg/kg D-limonene on days 10 and 11 post conceptionFootnote 9. No genotoxic effects were noted. In a mammalian comet assay (not GLP compliant, guideline not specified), D-limonene tested negative for genotoxicity (based on study summaryFootnote 4). In vitro: D-Limonene tested negative in an Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 102, TA 1535, TA 1537 and TA 1538 with and without metabolic activationFootnote 9Footnote 10Footnote 3. It also tested negative in a mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, with and without metabolic activationFootnote 9. Negative results were obtained in sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberration assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with and without metabolic activationFootnote 9Footnote 10. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: Does not meet criteria D-Limonene has been reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and has been classified as Group 3, "Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans"Footnote 11Footnote 12. D-Limonene has not been reviewed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). In a 2-year National Toxicology Program (NTP) carcinogenicity study performed similarly to OECD TG 451 and in compliance with GLP, D-limonene was administered through gavage to groups of 50 B6C3F1 mice per sex per dose at a dose of 0, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day (in males) or 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day (in females) for 103 weeks (5 days per week)Footnote 10. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity in any of the animals. In another 2-year study, D-limonene was administered to rats at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day in males or up to 600 mg/kg/day in females by gavageFootnote 10. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of D-limonene in female rats. There was, however, increased incidences of tubular cell hyperplasia, adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the kidney in male rats. The mechanism of nephron-carcinogenicity was shown to be rat-specific, mediated by alpha2μ-globulin and was not relevant to humans. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Carcinogenicity. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria In a developmental/teratogenicity study (guideline not specified), 4 groups of 20 Wistar female rats were orally administered 0, 591, or 2,869 mg/kg D-limonene on days 9-15 of gestationFootnote 9. At 2,869 mg/kg/day, increased maternal mortality and weight loss were reported. Fetal effects at this dose included delayed ossification of the metacarpal bone and proximal phalanx and decreased body weight. Fetal effects were considered secondary to maternal toxicity (due to the severity of the maternal effects). No effects were observed at the lower dose. Similar results were reported in a study with miceFootnote 9. In a rabbit study (guideline not specified), female rabbits were orally administered 0, 250, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day D-limonene on days 6-18 of gestationFootnote 9. Increased maternal mortality was noted at 1,000 mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at the two highest doses. No treatment-related effects were reported for the offspring. In a study that also examined sub-chronic toxicity and was performed similarly to OECD TG 408 and was also in compliance with GLP, D-limonene was administered through gavage to groups of 10 B6C3F1 mice per sex per dose at a dose of 0, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks (5 days per week) (based on study summaryFootnote 4). No effects on reproductive organs were observed at either the macroscopic or microscopic level. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In an acute rat oral toxicity study, mortality was observed close to the oral LD50 value (4,400 mg/kg in males)Footnote 1. No clinical signs were reported. In another study, that involved male rats and was non-guideline, the oral LD50 was reported to be > 5,000 mg/kg. Animals experienced lethargy but no deaths or clinical signs were reported. Dermal Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In a dermal acute toxicity animal study, no animals died and an LD50 value of > 5,000 mg/kg was reported (based on study summaryFootnote 4). No signs of toxicity were reported. Inhalation Route of Exposure: No human data are available. In a non-guideline study, mice were exposed to 570 mg/L of D-limonene aerosol for 1 minute (based on study summaryFootnote 4). No deaths occurred and only a slight respiratory depression was noted. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: In a 16-day sub-acute toxicity study performed similarly to OECD TG 407 and in compliance with GLP, D-limonene was administered through gavage to groups of 5 F344/N rats per sex per dose mixed in corn oil at a dose of 0, 413, 825, 1,650, 3,300, or 6,600 mg/kg/day for 16 days (5 days per week)Footnote 10. No treatment-related clinical signs were observed in rats that received doses of 1,650 mg/kg/day or lower. Mortality and reduced body weight gain were observed at the 2 highest doses. In a 13-week study, doses of D-limonene were administered orally to rats (150 to 2,400 mg/kg/day) and mice (125 to 2,000 mg/kg/day)Footnote 10. Only decreased activity and weight loss were noted in the high-dose groups. No weight gain depression was observed in any of the female groups. All animals survived. In a 2-year study in rats and mice, D-limonene was administered by gavage to groups of 50 male rats at a dose of 0, 75, or 150 mg/kg/day, of 50 female rats at 0, 300, or 600 mg/kg/day, of 50 male mice at 0, 250, or 500 mg/kg/day and of 50 female mice at 0, 500, or 1,000 mg/kg/day. Deaths occurred in high-dose female rats and low-dose male mice as well as reduced body weight gain in high-dose female mice. Nephropathy was observed in the kidneys of male rats. No other significant clinical effects were reportedFootnote 10. Dermal Route of Exposure: No data available Inhalation Route of Exposure: Volunteers were administered 10, 225, or 450 mg/m3 of D-limonene in an exposure chamber on 3 different occasions for a 2-hour period each. No signs of respiratory irritation or central nervous system effects were reported. A significant decrease in the vital capacity of volunteers was noted at the highest dose but was considered to be not functionally significantFootnote 13. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure. Aspiration Hazard: Category 1 No human data are available. D-Limonene is a liquid hydrocarbon. The dynamic viscosity is 0.897 mPa·s (0.846 centipoise) at 25 °CFootnote 4. The relative density is 0.844Footnote 4. The kinematic viscosity at 25 °C is calculated to be 1.063 cSt (0.897/0.844) or 1.063 mm2/s. It should be noted that the viscosity of D-Limonene was derived from a read-across with L-limonene, an enantiomer having the same physico-chemical properties.
