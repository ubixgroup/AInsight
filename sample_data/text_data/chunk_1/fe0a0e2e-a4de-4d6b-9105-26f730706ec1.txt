This symbol indicates that hazardous products with this pictogram can: damage or destroy metal cause irreversible damage to the skin (for example, burns, blisters, scarring) produce tissue damage in the eye or vision loss that is irreversible or not fully reversible within 21 days WHMIS classification Note: The classifications of silicic acid, sodium salt, depend on the concentration and molar ratio (MR) of SiO2:Na2O, which may vary from 1.5-4.0 Footnote 1,Footnote 2,Footnote 3. Sodium metasilicate, CAS # 6834-92-0, is the same as MR 1.0 Footnote 1. Health hazards: Acute Toxicity (Oral): Category 4 (MR 2.0) Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Category 1 (MR 1.6 at ≥52%, MR 2.4 at ≥44%, MR 0.5 at ≥90%); Category 2 (MR 2.0 at 19.5%) Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Category 1 (MR 2.0 at ≥19.5%); Category 2 (MR 2.4 at 19.5%) Physical hazards: Silicic acid, sodium salt, does not meet criteria for Physical Hazard classification. Health hazards Acute Toxicity (Oral): Acute Toxicity (Oral) - Category 4 (MR 2.0) Median lethal dose (LD50): 5,150 mg/kg (rat, MR 3.27)Footnote 3. LD50: 1,960 mg/kg (rat, MR 2.0)Footnote 4. LD50: 2,710 mg/kg (rat, MR 2.4)Footnote 4. The available data meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Oral) – Category 4 at MR 2.0 [HPR 8.1.1(1)]. Acute Toxicity (Dermal): Does not meet criteria LD50: >4,640 mg/kg (rabbit, MR 2.0 and 2.4)Footnote 4 The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Dermal). Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases): Not applicable Silicic acid, sodium salt, is not a gas. The classification criteria for Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Gases) do not apply to this substance. Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Vapours): No data available Acute Toxicity (Inhalation – Dusts and Mists): No data available Skin Corrosion / Irritation: Category 1 (MR 1.6 (≥52%), MR 2.4 (≥44%), MR 0.5 (≥90%)) Category 2 (MR 2.0 (19.5%)) Dermal corrosion or irritation caused by silicic acid, sodium salt, depends on the MR and concentration. Lower concentrations of the same MR exhibit lower corrosivity or irritancy compared to higher concentrations. In an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Test Guideline (OECD TG) 404 study in rabbits, a 53.5% aqueous solution of silicic acid, sodium salt, (MR 1.6) was tested to be corrosive (based on a study summary Footnote 5). The rabbits were exposed for 4 hours. Both the edema and erythema scores were 4/4 and the effects were irreversible after 14 days. In another well conducted study, application of 0.5 mL of 82% silicic acid, sodium salt, (MR 2.4) for 4 hours on 3 rabbits’ skin under semi-occlusive conditions resulted in necrotic skin lesions in 2/3 animals (based on a study summary Footnote 5). One animal had a wound that had not healed after 14 days. Another study tested aqueous solutions (19.5%) of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.4 and 2.0). Only the silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.0) had average scores (24- and 72-hour) of >2.3/4 for erythema and edema when applied for 24 hours on 6 rabbits’ intact skinFootnote 4. In a United States (U.S.) Department of Transportation (US DOT) skin test where rabbits were exposed to silicic acid, sodium salt, for 4 hours, a 90% solution of MR 0.5 was reported to be corrosiveFootnote 6. In a validation study for an in vitro assay (OECD TG 430: In Vitro Skin Corrosion: Transcutaneous Electrical Resistance Test Method (TER)), a 52% and a 44% aqueous solution of silicic acid, sodium salt, (MR 1.6 and 2.4, respectively) were found to be corrosive (based on a study summaryFootnote 5). Application of 0.5 mL of a 36, 80 or 99% solution of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.2), using a Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) method, where exposure is for 24 hours, resulted in a primary irritation index (PII) of 3, 0 and 4, respectively, and was reported to be not corrosiveFootnote 6. Silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.45), at a 40.93% concentration was reported to be not irritating to human skin (based on a study summaryFootnote 5). In a 4-hour exposure in human volunteers, silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.45 (34.9%)), caused slight scaling of the skin in 7/20 subjects, with the results reported to be not irritatingFootnote 3. In an OECD TG 404 study, a 38.25% solution of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.28), applied to the skin of a New Zealand White rabbit, was reported to be not irritatingFootnote 3. The available data meet the classification criteria for Skin Corrosion – Category 1 for silicic acid, sodium salt, at MR 0.5 (≥90%), MR 1.6 (≥52%), and MR 2.4 (≥44%) [HPR 8.2.2(2)]; and Skin Irritation – Category 2 at MR 2.0 (19.5%) [HPR 8.2.2(3)]. Serious Eye Damage / Eye Irritation: Category 1 (MR 2.0 (≥19.5%)); Category 2 (MR 2.4 (19.5%)) As with skin corrosion and irritation, the classification of eye irritation and serious eye damage depends on the MR and concentration of the substance. In a study conducted similarly to OECD TG 405, administration of 0.1 mL of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.0), at a concentration of 19.5% in the conjunctival sac of 6 rabbit eyes resulted in corneal opacity with scar tissue formation in 4/6 rabbitsFootnote 4. A 19.5% aqueous solution of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.4), in the same study produced an average score (24-, 48-, and 72-hour) of >1/2 for iritis in 2/6 animals and a conjunctival redness score of >2/3 in all 6 animalsFootnote 4. No individual scores were available after 72 hours to determine a subcategorization. In an FHSA test, specifying albino rabbits, silicic acid, sodium salt, MR 2.0 at a 44% concentration was reported to be severely irritatingFootnote 6; however, no scores or details on the effects were provided. In a study conducted with the same FHSA method, silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.2), was reported to be not irritating in albino rabbits at a concentration of 36%Footnote 6 No further details on the study were provided. The available data meet the classification criteria for Serious Eye Damage – Category 1 for silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.0) at ≥19.5% concentration [HPR 8.3.2(1)]; and Eye Irritation – Category 2 for MR 2.4 at a 19.5% concentration [HPR 8.3.2(3)]. Respiratory Sensitization: No data available Skin Sensitization: Does not meet criteria There is one documented case of exposure to silicic acid, sodium salt, causing contact dermatitis and contact urticaria in a 57-year-old man. He experienced an immediate hypersensitive reaction when exposed to 20% silicic acid, sodium salt (MR not specified), at the work placeFootnote 7. He tested positive in a patch test. A 20% aqueous solution of silicic acid, sodium salt (MR not specified), was then tested in 32 healthy volunteers, 22 of which (68%) had a positive response including skin irritation without ulcer formation 48 hours after the application Footnote 7. Histological findings suggested this as a case of primary irritant contact dermatitis rather than an allergic contact dermatitis. In a mouse Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) study, exposure to a 2-6% concentration of sodium metasilicate was found to be not sensitizing (based on a study summaryFootnote 5). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Skin Sensitization. Germ Cell Mutagenicity: Does not meet criteria In vivo: In an OECD TG 475 study, sodium metasilicate (MR 1.0), tested negative for chromosome aberration when administered in mice through oral feed even at dosage levels exceeding the maximally tolerated dose of 940 mg/kg (based on a study summary Footnote 5). In vitro: In an Ames test performed according to OECD TG 471, sodium metasilicate (MR 1.0), tested negative in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537, with and without metabolic activation (based on study summary Footnote 5. In an OECD TG 473 study, silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.3), tested negative in a chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells (V79), with and without metabolic activation (based on a study summary Footnote 5). The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Germ Cell Mutagenicity. Carcinogenicity: No data available Silicic acid, sodium salt, has not been reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), or the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). It is relevant to note that sodium silicates have had a long history of safe use in numerous food-related applicationsFootnote 8. Sodium silicate and potassium silicate have been granted GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for addition to canned drinking water as a corrosion preventative at concentrations up to 100 ppmFootnote 6. No carcinogenicity data are available for silicic acid, sodium salt. Reproductive Toxicity: Does not meet criteria In a mouse study, animals were administered 12.5, 50 or 200 mg/kg/day of sodium metasilicate (MR 1.0) by gavage from day 0 to 18 of gestation (based on study summaryFootnote 5). No treatment-related effects were observed in mothers, fetuses delivered by hysterectomy, or neonates. No parturition fatalities were observed when mothers were allowed to deliver their young naturally. There was a dose-related, but not statistically significant decrease in litter size. A dose-related, but not statistically significant decrease in embryo weight and delayed ossification process were also observed. No treatment-related effects on pups' body weight gain were observed in any dose group. In a non-standard multi-generational rat study testing silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.2), animals received 0, 600, or 1,200 ppm (based on SiO2 content) in drinking water Footnote 9. Mortality and clinical signs of the parental generation were not reported but there was a significant decrease in offspring born. However, the number of offspring is the accumulated total from litters from 5 generations. The results of this study cannot be considered reliable for classification due to the experimental design. Only 2 doses were tested in a very small number of F0 generation animals (6/sex/group), there was no stability testing on drinking water, and the wire-bottom cages allowed newborns to fall out of the cage. The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Reproductive Toxicity. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: In a single dose toxicity animal study, rats (5/sex/group) were treated with 20% silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.0 and 2.4), at a dose of 464, 1,000, 2,150 or 4,640 mg/kg by gavageFootnote 4. No apparent signs of toxicity were noted at the 464 mg/kg dose level. Animals treated with MR 2.0 and MR 2.4 at all other dose levels showed signs of gasping, dyspnea and acute depression. However, no confirmatory necropsies were performed. The available data do not meet the criteria for classification. Dermal Route of Exposure: No signs of toxicity were observed in a single-dose toxicity study where rabbits were exposed to 4,640 mg/kg of 19.5% silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 2.0 and MR 2.4), dermallyFootnote 4. Inhalation Route of Exposure: No data available The available data do not meet the classification criteria for Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Single Exposure. Specific Target Organ Toxicity – Repeated Exposure: Does not meet criteria Oral Route of Exposure: An oral exposure of weanling rats to silicic acid, sodium salt (MR 3.2), via drinking water at 789.5 and 1,587 mg/L for 180 days did not result in any adverse effectsFootnote 9. Some statistically significant differences were observed in body weight between experimental groups and controls but these were small (6% or less), not consistent, and not dose related. In a 28-day repeat-dose toxicity study in rats performed according to OECD TG 407, ingestion of silicic acid, sodium salt, of no specified MR, up to a dose level of 2,400 mg/kg/day did not result in any toxicity (based on a study summaryFootnote 5).
