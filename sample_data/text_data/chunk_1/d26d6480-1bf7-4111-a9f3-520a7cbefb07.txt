The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to sample free standing clothing storage units over 27 inches (686 mm) in height and test them to the performance criteria of a consensus-based safety standard in order to verify compliance to the CCPSA. The safety standard used as a basis for the project testing was ASTM F2057-19, Standard Safety Specification for Clothing Storage Units. For this project, compliance of select clothing storage units was determined through a sampling and testing process by which Health Canada inspectors sampled relevant products from establishments. Compliance with the requirements listed under the ASTM standard was then verified through testing at the Product Safety Laboratory. Prior to initiating this CV project, the CPSP carried out a market survey to determine the presence of clothing storage units companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. Over the course of the 2021-2022 fiscal year, mechanical testing of 19 different products was carried out. The testing resulted in three voluntary recalls to address non-compliances. There were 16 instances in which no corrective action was required. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature of sampling and the fact that sample sizes within CV projects are very small, the findings of CV projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually tested and the specific criteria indicated. Testing by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
