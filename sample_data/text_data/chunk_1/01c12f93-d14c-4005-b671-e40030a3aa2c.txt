Notes: CANLINE is the Food Directorate's (Health Canada) searchable database for chemical, nutritional, and microbiological laboratory surveillance data. This includes data from Canada's Total Diet Study and other targeted surveillance data on contaminants in food. 

CANLINE data can be searched by sample characteristics, food category, contaminant, pathogen, nutrient, geographical details, and date, or combinations of the above. Search results can be exported in various formats.

Please note that new data is added to CANLINE on an on-going basis.

The glossary and instructions are available on the CANLINE website.
