Pharmacare Bill Legislation
What is the purpose of Bill C-64?
Bill C-64 formally outlines the federal government’s intention to work with provincial and territorial
partners to collaborate on the step-by-step approach towards national pharmacare.
The Bill sets out the next steps that the Government of Canada will take, starting with universal,
single-payer, first-dollar coverage for a range of contraception and diabetes medications. Budget
2024 announced $1.5 billion over 5 years to support this commitment.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Beyond contraception and diabetes medications, the Bill also includes a commitment for the
federal government to maintain long-term funding for the provinces, territories and Indigenous
peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical products, beginning with
drugs for rare diseases. This long-term funding includes the federal commitment of up to $1.5
billion dollars towards a National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases.
In addition, the Bill commits the Minister of Health to seek advice from the independent Canada’s
Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) on several components that would inform a way forward on national
pharmacare. This includes seeking advice of the Agency on the development of a list of essential
prescription drugs and related products to inform the development of a national formulary and a
national bulk purchasing strategy. The Bill commits the Minister to publish a pan-Canadian strategy
regarding the appropriate use ofprescription drugs and related products, which will be informed by
CDA-AMC’s work in this area.
Finally, the Bill requires the Minister to establish a committee of experts to make recommendations
on the operation and financing of national, universal, single-payer pharmacare in Canada
Q1. How much is this going to cost?
Budget 2024 confirmed $1.5B over five years to launch national pharmacare in Canada. This means
working with provinces and territories to increase existing public pharmacare coverage to provide
universal, single-payer, first-dollar coverage for a range ofcontraception and diabetes medications.
Separately, the Government of Canada would also create a fund for diabetes devices and supplies
such as continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps, syringes and test strips.
Further, Bill C-64 commits to maintaining long-term funding for the provinces, territories, and
Indigenous peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical products.
If pressed on future cost of “full” pharmacare (hypothetical):
Bill C-64 states that the Government will proceed “step by step” with provinces and territories,
Indigenous Peoples, partners and stakeholders towards national universal pharmacare. The Bill
requires the development of expert advice from Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) to support that
future conversation.
Until these discussions have occurred and decisions on future national pharmacare have been
taken, it is not possible to define a cost.
If pressed on what others have said about the cost of pharmacare:
In 2019, the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare estimated it would
cost an additional $3.5 billion in 2022 to launch national pharmacare starting with universal
coverage for essential medicines, reaching $15.3 billion by 2027 asthe national formulary grows.
In May 2024, Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) estimated that the first phase of national universal
pharmacare will increase federal spending by $1.9 billion over five years. This estimate assumes
that any medications that are currently covered by provincial and territorial governments, as well as
private insurance providers will remain covered on the same terms. A 2023 report released from the
PBO estimated the incremental public cost to implement a single-payer universal drug plan would
be $11.2B in 2024/25, increasing to $13.4B in 2027/28.
Bill C-64 states that the Government will proceed “step by step” with provinces and territories,
Indigenous Peoples, partners and stakeholders towards national universal pharmacare. The Bill
requires the development of expert advice from Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) to support that
future conversation.
Until these discussions have occurred and decisions on future national pharmacare have been
taken, it is not possible to define a cost
Q2. What savings will be generated?
While quantifying savings is challenging, evidence suggests that federal investments in better drug
coverage will yield savings for the health system over time due to improved population health
outcomes.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Studies have demonstrated that publicly funded contraception can result in public cost savings.
Evidence from the University of British Columbia (BC) estimated that no-cost contraception has the
potential to save the BC health care system approximately $27million per year. In England, the
return on investment (ROI) for publicly funded contraception over ten years was found to be £9.00,
i.e., a £9.00 saving for every £1 invested when accounting for savings across all public services
such as healthcare, education and social programs (Public Health England, 2018).
Existing data also suggests actions to address the costs of managing diabetes has the potential to
bring savings to the health care system and economy. In 2015, 25% of Canadians with diabetes
indicated following their treatments were affected by cost, in some cases rationing medications to
save money. Uncontrolled diabetes can have very serious short and long-term health impacts and
represents a burden to individuals, families, and Canadian society. High and unnecessary costs are
incurred from lost productivity and elevated health-care system use due to diabetes and its
complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and amputation. These
complications not only have devastating effects for the individual, but come at a high cost to the
health care system and economy. The full cost of diabetes to the healthcare system in 2018 is
estimated to be around $27 billion and could exceed $39 billion by 2028.
Q3. When will other drugs be added and what is the process to do that?
This Bill outlines a framework that would help guide collaboration and step by step implementation
with provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, stakeholders and partners to develop national
universal pharmacare over time, based on the four foundationalprinciples outlined in the Bill.
The Bill also sets out processes and next steps for other foundational elements of national
pharmacare, including work on a national formulary, a national bulk purchasing plan, an
appropriate use strategy and an expert committee to study operations and financing.
The consideration of adding other drugs, whether further diabetes and contraception drugs, or
other drugs altogether, will be part of that future conversation about the future of national universal
pharmacare.
Q4. What could be the impact on private drug insurance? Should peopleopt-out of their private
insurance plan if their province accepts funding for contraception and diabetes?
Canadians who have private drug insurance would likely also have coverage for a broader scope of
drug classes beyond the specific contraception and diabetes medications outlined in the Bill. As
such, Canadians who live in provinces or territories that signbilateral agreements typically should
not opt out of their private drug insurance plans.
After public plans have begun coverage, private plans that currently offer coverage for the range of
specified diabetes and contraception identified in Bill C-64 will most likely direct their beneficiaries
to the relevant provincial or territorial drug plan for this coverage. This would be consistent with the
intent of Bill C-64 respecting universal, single payer coverage.
Q5. Why doesn’t this Bill follow the recommendations outlined in the Advisory Council/ Hoskins
report?
This preamble text of the Bill recognizes the work and recommendations of the Advisory Council
and the Bill follows several recommendations of the report, including:
Taking a step by step approach to the implementation of pharmacare in partnership with PTs and
Indigenous populations;
Having essential medicines as a starting point in the development of a national formulary;
Establishing Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) that would help develop a national formulary, a
bulk purchasing strategy, and report on appropriate use; and,
Recognizing the need to improve access to drugs for rare diseases.
Q6. Why is there currently funding to PEI for its program and no other province or territory?
The Government has been clear that there have been enough studies about pharmacare and
lessons drawn from international cases. The Government has moved to action, and testing different
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
approaches in the Canadian context to develop lessons learned in Canada about how national
universal pharmacare can work.
This is the context for PEI.
PEI signaled its interest in participating in a demonstration initiative and an agreement was
announced on August 11, 2021. Through this agreement, PEI received $35 million in federal funding
to add new drugs to its list of covered drugs and lower out of pocket costs for drugs covered under
existing public plans for Island residents.
PEI’s efforts through the demonstration initiative have seen promising results, demonstrating
practically how affordability and accessibility principles can be achieved in Canada. The
Government of Canada will use these lessons to inform future discussionswith PTs about the
future of pharmacare, as set out in Bill C-64.
Q7. Have discussions taken place with other provinces and territories? Are they supportive?
Formal discussions to sign agreements will occur with all provinces or territories once this Bill is
passed.
Some have already signalled their interest publicly in signing onto these agreements.Health
Canada officials have held informal information sharing discussions with provinces and territories
this summer to support being ready for more formal discussions. This has helped to clarify the
structure and intent of the Bill for PTs and enhanced the understanding of the specific
implementation considerations in each jurisdiction.
Q8. What will the national formulary look like and how will it be covered under national universal
pharmacare?
A national formulary is a list of prescription drugs and products which all Canadians would expect
to have access to under whatever model of national universal pharmacare might be adopted.
Bill C-64 sets out a multi-step process for the development of advice about a national formulary by
the CDA-AMC within a year of royal assent. The Agency will have its own consultation and
engagement process. Following that work, there will be broad discussions with provinces,
territories, Indigenous Peoples, partners and stakeholders about the directions to take on national
pharmacare, including the advice on the national formulary. As such, it is too early to say what a
national formulary might look like,how it will be maintained through time, or how it will be covered
in future national pharmacare.
The advice on the formulary is a distinct exercise from the published lists of specified diabetes and
contraception medicines that are being covered through the funding for Bill C-64. The lessons
learned from coverage of these specified drugs will be partof the same conversation with partners
about the next steps on national pharmacare.
Q9. What is the bulk purchasing strategy?
The bulk purchasing strategy will not include the physical purchase and stockpile of drugs by the
Government of Canada on behalf of responsible governments.
In simple terms, a bulk purchasing strategy means a coordinated price negotiation approach to
maximize negotiating power and lead to lower drug prices for all Canadians.
The pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) already does this for public plans, both
provincial territorial and federal. The vision of national pharmacare is to extend this power in such a
way that all 40 million Canadians benefit from lower drug prices.
This Bill tasks the Minister to request CDA-AMC develop advice on how to do this no later than the
first anniversary of the day on which the Act receives royal assent. The pCPA will be an important
model for this advice.
Q10. What does appropriate use mean?
In Canada, over 750 million prescriptions worth $42.8B are written annually. A growing body of
evidence suggests that prescribing is often suboptimal, affecting patient safety and leading to
significant negative health, social, and financial impacts.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Inappropriate use can be driven by:
the prescriber, such as prescribing too many medications per patient
the patient, such as taking drugs not prescribed for them, and/or
health policies, such as outdated prescribing guidance.
Appropriate use in one of the four principles outlined in Bill C-64 that the Minister must consider
when collaborating to implement national pharmacare —namely, in a manner that prioritizes
patient safety, optimizes health outcomes and reinforces healthsystem sustainability—in order to
improve the physical and mental health and well-being of Canadians.
To this end, the Bill also commits the Minister to publish a pan-Canadian strategy regarding the
appropriate use of prescription drugs and related products, which will be informed by Canada’s
Drug Agency’s (CDA-AMC)’s work in this area. The Bill further provides that the Minister may request
for CDA-AMC to report on the progress made in advancing that strategy.
Q11. What is the role of the committee of experts and who will be part of it?
As outlined in Section 11(1) of the Bill, the Minister will establish a committee of experts no later
than 30 days after the day on which this Act receives royal assent, and provide for its membership,
to make recommendations respecting options for the operation and financing of national,
universal, single-payer pharmacare.
The size and membership of the committee is yet to be determined. We expect the membership will
be selected to reflect the interests of PTs, Indigenous peoples, partners and stakeholders, as
outlined the in the Bill, such as representation for patients.
Q12. Does this Bill create the mandate for Canada’s Drug Agency?
The creation of Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) was announced on December 18, 2023. CDA-
AMC was built from the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and in
partnership with PTs.
It is an independent organization with a governing board that is diverse and includes
representatives from the provincial, territorial and federal governments, as well as from Canada’s
health system, academia, and members of the public.
The Bill does not create anything regarding the Agency’s organizational mandate, governance, or
funding.
Bill C-64 sets out a variety of areas where the Minister may seek technical advice from CDA-AMC. It
also requires that the Minister of Health request that CDA-AMC prepare a list of essential
prescription drugs and related products to inform the developmentof a national formulary and
develop advice on a national bulk purchasing strategy.
Q13. What will be the impact of the pharmacare bill on Indigenous Peoples in Canada?
The Bill commits to engaging and collaborating with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis governments and
representative organizations on the implementation of national universal pharmacare.
The Bill does not change any current federal programs for Indigenous Peoples, such as drug
coverage for registered First Nations and recognized Inuit through the Non-Insured Health Benefits
(NIHB) Program.
Q14. In BC and soon in MB, contraceptives are already free. What will this new federal program
mean for them?
The intent of Bill C-64 is to ensure the provision of universal, single-payer, first dollar coverage for a
range of diabetes and contraception drugs and devices to improve the health outcomes of
Canadians who currently cannot afford them.
As health system savings are realized by provinces and territories because Canadians are healthier
and health costs are falling, the federal government would expect that provinces and territories
would reinvest those savings back into their health systems.This could be by way of additional
support for contraception or diabetes related coverage improvements for their residents or other
coverage improvements in keeping with the overall direction of the Bill.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
The same principle applies to provinces who are already providing the coverage standard set out in
Bill C-64.
Q15. How will this Bill apply in Quebec for contraceptive and diabetes coverage?
Quebec has a universal, mixed payer model which ensures that their residents always have some
form of public or private drug coverage.
The Government of Canada is willing to enter into a bilateral agreement with any province or
territory that wishes to implement the universal, single-payer, first dollar coverage standard,
including Quebec.
Q16. How long will it take to get to full pharmacare if this is a foundational step?
The 2019 Advisory Panel proposed a step-by-step approach and implementation over seven years.
This recognized the complexity of prescription drug affordability and access in Canada, taking into
consideration the various ways Canadians may receive drug coverage.
The Bill would guide collaboration with PTs, Indigenous Peoples, stakeholders, and partners to
develop national universal pharmacare over time, based on the foundational principles outlined in
the Bill.
However, there is no timeline specified in the Bill for these discussions to respect this collaborative
process with partners.
Q17. Are the new Patented Medicines Regulations in force if there are no PMPRB Guidelines?
Yes. The regulatory changes came into force on July 1, 2022 and are in effect. Patentees are now
required to file their price information for the new basket of comparator countries. The new basket
removes the United States and Switzerland and adds countries that have similar economies to
Canada and consider consumer protection, such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. (PMPRB
11: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and
UK.)
The PMPRB has launched a consultation process in support of introducing new guidelines.
Questions on the use or the application of existing or futureguidelines should be addressed to the
PMPRB.
If pressed on the HESA report on PMPRB:
The Government thanks the Standing Committee on Health for their examination of the PMPRB and
the associated recommendations within their recent Report.
The Government of Canada supports and respects the PMPRB’s role as an independent quasi-
judicial body that protects the interests of Canadian consumers by ensuring that the prices of
patented medicines sold in Canada are not excessive.
The Government of Canada is collaborating with the PMPRB and other partners to advance actions
already underway in many of the areas covered by the Committee's recommendations.
2.Pharmacare–Key Facts and Figures
Population in Canada
41M Canadians (Stats Can, Q2 2024)
Large population range: 15.9M Residents in ON vs. 40.7K in Nunavut (Stats Can, Q2 2024)
Canada's population grew by 3.2% between Jan 1, 2023 and Jan 1 , 2024.
Most provinces and territories had net losses in interprovincial migration in the first quarter of 2024,
except for AB (+12,482), NB (+1,627) and YT (+60).
In the first quarter of 2024, the Maritime provinces of NS (+3,999), NB (+3,999) and PEI (+1,330)
each welcomed their highest number of immigrants.
Drug Coverage in Canada
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
There are more than 100 government-run and more than 100,000 private drug plans in Canada.
There is a reasonably high degree of alignment among public drug plan formularies in Canada
(average bilateral rate of agreement 82%).
Timelines to list vary by jurisdiction (e.g., For oncology drugs, in 2022, it took 54 days on average for
QC vs. 243 days for PEI after pCPA reaches agreement with the manufacturer).
Most drug plans involve out-of-pocket costs, such as copays and deductibles, ranging from 10-
100% of the drug cost.
2/3 (24.7M) of Canadians live in a province with a “catastrophic coverage” plan with income-based
deductibles.
The vast majority of Canadians do not currently have no-cost coverage for contraception and
diabetes medications.
Only 2.8% of Canadians (1.1 M) are uninsured, i.e., do not have private drug coverage and are not
eligible for public coverage (Conference Board of Canada, 2022).
But more than one in every five (21%) adults in Canada reported not having the prescription
insurance they needed to cover medication costs (Statistics Canada, 2021).
Diabetes in Canada
There are 3.7 million people living with diabetes in Canada (PHAC, 2020/21).
Approximately 1 million Canadians rely on insulin to treat their diabetes.
In 2015, 25% of Canadians with diabetes indicated following their treatments was affected by cost,
in some cases rationing medications to save money. (Canadian Diabetes Association survey, 2015)
The full cost of diabetes to the healthcare system in 2018 is estimated to be around $27 billion and
could exceed $39 billion by 2028 (Diabetes Canada, 2018).
Economists have estimated that the opportunity costs associated with diabetes account for more
than 80% of the total costs of diabetes in Canada (Doucet & Beatty, 2010).
Contraception in Canada
There are 9 million women of reproductive age (i.e., 15-49 years), making up nearly one quarter of
the Canadian population (22.5% in 2022).
Cost has been identified as the most significant barrier to accessing contraception in Canada.
Oral contraceptives cost approximately $25 per unit, or $300 per year.
Intrauterine Devices (IUDs), which are effective for five years, cost approximately up to $500 per
unit.
Studies have demonstrated that publicly funded contraception can result in cost savings.
No-cost contraception has the potential to save the BC health care system approximately $27
million per year (UBC, 2018).
In England, the return on investment (ROI) for publicly funded contraception over ten years was
found to be £9.00, i.e., a £9.00 saving for every £1 invested when accounting for savings across all
public services such as healthcare, education and social programs (Public Health England, 2018).
Pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA)
Estimated savings to participating public drug plans (April 2024): $4.63B annually
Brand: $3.7 billion
Generic: $914 million
Cumulative savings since inception: $24 billion
Budget 2024
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Budget 2024 proposes to provide $1.5 billion over five years, starting in 2024-25, to Health Canada
to support the launch of national pharmacare.
National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases
In March 2023, the Government of Canada announced the launch of the first-ever National Strategy
for Drugs for Rare Diseases, with an investment of up to $1.5B over three years.
July 23, 2024, British Columbia signed the first bilateral agreement under the National Strategy,
which provides $194 million over three years to improve access to new and existing drugs, early
diagnosis, and screening for rare diseases.
The National Strategy also includes $33 million in funding for ISC’s Non-Insured Health Benefits
Program to further support eligible First Nations and Inuit patients living with rare diseases.
Since March 2023 the National Strategy has been launching various other initiatives to help improve
consistent access to drugs for rare diseases (DRD) across the country, including:
As part of the $20 million over three years to CDA-AMC and Canadian Institute for Health
Information (CIHI), to launch multiple projects to support DRDs in Canada
As part of the $32 million over five years to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), four
funding opportunities were launched to support a number of DRD research projects.
As part of the $16 million over three years to support the establishment of national governance
structures, the Government has created a Health Canada secretariat and launched the
Implementation Advisory Group (IAG).
Improving Affordable Access to Prescription Drugs (IAAPD) in PEI
Announced on August 11, 2021 with $35 million of federal funding (2021-22 to 2025-26).
Through the program, PEI has improved access to more than 100 prescription drugs and resulted in
saving residents over $6 million in out-of-pocket costs.
Canada’s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC)
On December 18, 2023, announced investment of $89.5 million over five years to support the
creation of CDA-AMC.
CDA-AMC is being built in partnership with provinces and territories (PTs) from the existing
Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH).
CADTH officially launched as the CDA on May 1, 2024.
National Formulary
Following broad consultations, a multidisciplinary panel released its final report in June 2022
recommending principles and a process for developing a national formulary.
As a test case for itsproposed process, the panel also developed a sample list of commonly
prescribed drugs and related products for three therapeutic areas with a high volume of drug use in
Canada: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mental illness.
There are also other formularies to use as references:
The WHO Essential Medicines List includes approximately 600 products listed at the drug level (i.e.,
active ingredient).
The CLEAN Meds List from St. Michael’s Hospital includes 136 drugs (active ingredient).
Private plans typically list nearly all of the drug products approved for sale in Canada (approx.
13,000 drug products (DINs)).
In contrast, public plans in Canada range from 4,000 to 8,000 unique drug products (DINs) on their
formularies.
Healthcare Spending in 2023
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Drugs spending: 13.9% of total health spending; $1,217 per person; 3.0% annual growth per
person.
Hospitals spending: 25.6% of total health spending; $2,240 per person; 3.0% annual growth per
person
Physicians spending: 13.8% of total health spending; $1,207 per person; 5.8% annual growth per
person
Prescribed Drug Spending in Canada
In 2023, the total drug spending was $41.1B
43% ($17.78B) was public drug plan spending
37% (15.28B) was private plan spending
20% (8.38B) was out-of-pocket spending by Canadians
Public drug program spending in Canada was $17.2B in 2022.
Spending increased by 6.4% from 2021, compared with a 7.4% increase from 2020 to 2021.
43.3% of public drug program spending was for the 2.2% of beneficiaries for whom a drug program
paid $10,000 or more.
Drug Prices
Canadian list prices were third highest among the 31 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries, lower than prices in the US and Switzerland.
Sales of patented medicines in Canada were $17.4B in 2021, a slight decrease of 1.7% from the
previous year.
Patented medicines accounted for approximately 51.0% of the sales of all medicines in Canada in
2021.
Drug Approvals
Canada’s drug approval timelines are comparable to its international counterparts
Canada has consistently met its 300 calendar day service standard over 99% of the time from
2020/21 to 2022/23.

An Act respecting pharmacare
This Bill represents the first phase in the federalgovernment’s commitment to establish national
universal pharmacare.
Sets the federal government’s framework to guide its efforts with partners to improve prescription
drug accessibility, affordability, universal coverage and appropriate use, for all Canadians.
Formalizes a requirement to work collaboratively with provinces and territories and Indigenous
peoples to build national universal pharmacare through a step-by-step approach.
Describes the Government’s intent to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a range of
contraception and diabetes medications through collaborative arrangements with willing provinces
and territories.
Supports the development of a national formulary of essential prescription drugs and related
products and the development of a national bulk purchasing strategy, to be led by the Canadian
Drug Agency.
Principles
The bill outlines that the Minister is to consider the following principles and the Canada Health Act,
when collaborating with provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples and other partners and
stakeholders towards national universal pharmacare:
improve the accessibility of pharmaceutical products, including through their coverage, in a
manner that is more consistent across Canada;
improve the affordability of pharmaceutical products, including by reducing financial barriers for
Canadians;
support the appropriate use of pharmaceutical products—namely, in a manner that prioritizes
patient safety, optimizes health outcomes and reinforces health system sustainability—in order to
improve the physical and mental health and well-being of Canadians; and
provide universal coverage of pharmaceutical products across Canada.
The principles included in the bill are intended to guide efforts to improve coverage for Canadians
and align with ongoing work related to drugs for rare diseases and the Canadian Drug Agency.
Bilateral Agreements and Funding
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
This Bill legislates a path to bilateral agreements with willing provinces and territories by providing a
federal commitment tolong-term pharmacare funding beginning with existing funding for drugs for
rare diseases as announced in Budget 2019.
If the Minister enters in a bilateral agreement with a willing province or territory, the Minister may
provide funding to that province or territory, to increase any existing pharmacare coverage, allowing
the province or territory to provide universal, single-payer, first dollar coverage, for specific
prescription drugs and related products intended for contraception or the treatment of diabetes.
Specific Contraception and Diabetes Medications
The Government will work with willing provinces and territories to implement coverage for specific
contraception and diabetes medications through bilateral agreements, per the Bill. Funding will
enhance, rather than replace, existing provincial and territorial spending on public drug benefit
programs.
The specific contraception and diabetes medications are listed in the backgrounders.
Starting with these drugs is part of the step-by-step approach set out in the Bill.
Provides an opportunity to test the application of the principles of improving access, affordability,
appropriate use and universal coverage at a national scale within the context of the complexity of
Canada’s healthcare system.
Provides for a nationally consistent approach that some provinces have already begun to
implement to support uptake of effective contraception methods.
Benefits people living with and managing diabetes and helps ensure that these individuals are able
to afford the drugs that they need.
The Minister will also work with PTs to establish a fund for diabetes devices and supplies to support
patients in managing their diabetes and administering their medication.
The Canadian Drug Agency (CDA)
On December 18, 2023, the Government of Canada announced the creation of the Canadian Drug
Agency (CDA). The CDA will be built from the existing Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies
in Health (CADTH) and in partnership with provinces and territories(PTs).
The bill outlines the functions of the CDA, a key foundational element of national pharmacare, as
outlined below:
Clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis
Advice to inform formulary listing by federal, provincial and territorial drug plans
Pharmaceutical data and analytics
Appropriate prescribing and use Pharmaceutical system coordination
National Formulary and Bulk Purchasing Strategy
After discussions with the provinces and territories, the Bill requires that the Minister request that
the CDA:
1.prepare a list of essential prescription drugs and related products to inform the development of a
national formulary that will establish the scope of prescription drugs and related products to which
Canadians should have access under national universal pharmacare.
Upon completion of this list, the Minister must initiate discussions with provinces, territories,
Indigenous peoples and other partners and stakeholders with the aim of continuing to work toward
the implementation of national universal pharmacare.
2.develop, in collaboration with partners and stakeholders, a national bulk purchasing strategy.
The Minister must request the CDA complete the list and strategy no later than the first anniversary
of the day on which this Act receives royal assent.
Appropriate Use Strategy
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Work to advance a pan-Canadian strategy for appropriate use began in March 2023, with the launch
of an Advisory Committee to inform the strategy and a corresponding program.
An Appropriate Use Strategy section commits the Minister to:
ensuring that a pan-Canadian strategy for appropriate use is published no later than one year after
royal assent of the Act and,
requesting that the CDA prepare reports every three years on the progress made in advancing the
strategy.
Committee of Experts
The Minister must, within 30 days of the day on which this Act receives royal assent, establish a
committee of experts, and provide for its membership, to make recommendations respecting
options for the operation and financing of national, universal, single-payer pharmacare.
The committee must, no later than the first anniversary of the day on which this Act receives royal
assent, provide a written report to the Minister setting out its recommendations.
Summary of Next Steps
Should this Bill be passed:
The Minister will establish a committee of experts, within thirty days of the day after this Act
receives royal assent. Appointment of committee members would be shared publicly.
Ministerial outreach will commence on next steps, including discussions with provinces and
territories regarding bilateral agreements.
The Minister will request that within one year on which this Act receives royal assent, the Canadian
Drug Agency:
prepare a list of essential prescription drugs and related products to inform the development of a
national formulary, and
develop a national bulk purchasing strategy.
Initiatives that are underway related to affordable prescription medicines in Prince Edward Island,
efforts under the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases, and work by the Canadian Drug
Agency, will all continue and will be evaluated for their lessons learned for national universal
pharmacare in Canada.

For Immediate Release
Government of Canada Introduces Legislation for First Phase of National Universal Pharmacare
Legislation includes universal access to contraception and diabetes medications.
February 29, 2024 | Ottawa, Ontario | HealthCanada
Today, the Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health, introduced Bill C-64, An Act respecting
pharmacare (Pharmacare Act), which proposes the foundational principles for first phase of
national universal pharmacare in Canada and describes the Governmentof Canada’s intent to
work with provinces and territories (PTs) to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of
contraception and diabetes medications.
The Minister also announced the government’s plan to establish a fund to support Canadians’
access to supplies that diabetics require to manage and monitor their condition and administer
their medication, such as syringes and glucose test strips.
This legislation is an important step forward to improve health equity, affordability, and outcomes
and has the potential of long-term savings to the health care system.
Coverage for contraceptives will mean that 9 million Canadians of reproductive age will have better
access to contraception and reproductive autonomy, reducing the risk of unintended pregnancies
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
and improving their ability to plan for the future. Cost has consistently been identified as the single
most important barrier to access to these medications and the cost is unevenly borne by women
and gender diverse Canadians. Bill C-64 will ensure that Canadians will have access to a
comprehensive suite of contraceptive drugs and devices.
Diabetes is a complex disease that has no cure but can be treated with safe and effective
medications. One in four Canadians with diabetes have reported not following their treatment plan
due to cost.Improving access to diabetes medications will help improve the health of 3.7 million
Canadians living with diabetes and reduce the risk of serious life-changing health complications
such as blindness or amputations.
Over the past year, the Government of Canada has delivered on key actions to provide better and
more accessible health care in Canada. Financial barriers should not be an impediment to
accessing safe and effective prescription drugs and related products. We are determined to work
towards a plan where Canadians can obtain their medication as prescribed, regardless of where
they live or their ability to pay.
The Bill demonstrates the Government of Canada’s commitment to consulting widely about the
way forward and working with provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples and other partners and
stakeholders to improve the accessibility, affordability and appropriate use of pharmaceutical
products, by reducing financial barriers and contributing to physical and mental health and well-
being.
Bill C-64 also provides that the new Canadian Drug Agency work towards the development of a
national formulary, develop a national bulk purchasing strategy, and support the publication of a
pan-Canadian strategy regarding the appropriate use of prescription medications.
Together, these elements would form the key next steps towards national universal pharmacare in
Canada. The Minister would further establish a committee of experts to make recommendations on
the operation and financing of national, universal, single-payerpharmacare in Canada.
Bill C-64 proposes a significant change to our heath care landscape, which, together with the
learnings from ongoing initiatives such as the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases and the
Improving Affordable Access to Prescriptions Drugs initiativewith Prince Edward Island, are part of
the Government of Canada’s plan to ensure Canadians can access the medicines they need and
pave the way forward towards the implementation of national universal pharmacare in Canada.
Quotes
“Each and every Canadian should have access to the prescription drugs they need. That’s why
we’re working with our partners towards the first phase of national universal pharmacare. This
important next step will provide universal access to contraception and diabetes medication that
will be transformational in improving health outcomes in Canada.”
The Honourable Mark Holland Minister of Health
Quick Facts
On December 18, 2023, the Government of Canada announced the creation of the Canadian Drug
Agency with an investment of over $89.5 million over 5 years, starting in 2024-25. The Agency will
provide the dedicated leadership and coordination needed to make Canada’s drug system more
sustainable and prepared for the future and help Canadians achieve better health outcomes.
On March 22 2023, the Government of Canada announced measures in support of the first-ever
National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases, with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three
years to help increase access to, and the affordability of, effective drugs for rare diseases. Bill C-64
commits to a model for long-term funding, beginning with funding for the National Strategy for
Drugs for Rare Diseases and to be primarily provided through bilateral agreements with provinces
and territories.
PEI residents have saved over $2 million in out-of-pocket costs on more than 230,000 prescriptions
under PEI’s $5 copay program, which was launched in June 2023 and reduced copays for almost
60% of medications regularly used by Island residents. These latest improvements are an important
milestone of the Improving Affordable Access to Prescriptions Drugs (IAAPD) initiative that provides

federal funding to PEI to improve access to prescription drugs and make prescriptions drugs more
affordable for Island residents.
Part B. QP Notes
5.PHARMACARE
The possible impact of the Pharmacare Act on populations with unmet needs: women, low income
households, persons with disabilities, persons with chronic diseases
KEY FACTS
While the vast majority of Canadians have access to some form of drug coverage, many households
still struggle to afford needed medications.
Patient charges (e.g., premiums, copays, deductibles, and plan maximums) under existing public
andprivate drug plans present cost barriers for many individuals and households.
Low-income households, women, gender diverse individuals, 2SLGBTQI+ populations, racialized
communities, persons with chronic diseases, and persons with disabilities experience additional
barriers in accessing the drugs they need. These populations tend toexperience higher cost-related
non-adherence, which means they are foregoing or reducing doses due to cost.
Factors such as lower wages, poorer access to private coverage through an employer and possibly
greater need for high cost medications have resulted in these populations experiencing high out-of-
pocket costs for the drugs they need.
According to the Canadian Survey on Disabilities, 13% of all persons with disabilities aged 15 years
and over had unmet needs for prescription drug due to cost.
A 2022 report by Statistics Canada found the percentages of people reporting not having
prescription insurance to cover drug costs was higher among immigrants (29%) relative to non-
immigrants (17%) and among racialized persons (29%) relative to non racialized and non-
Indigenous persons (17%).
KEY MESSAGES
No Canadian should have to choose between paying for prescription drugs and putting food on the
table. Unfortunately, many are still forced to make this impossible decision.
That is why the Government of Canada continues to work with provinces, territories and
stakeholders to ensure that Canadians have better access to the drugs they need.
Women, gender diverse persons, 2SLGBTQI+ populations, racialized communities, persons with
chronic diseases and persons with disabilities, particularly those in low-income households, often
face barriers to receiving the drugs they need for themselves or their loved ones due to out-of
pocket costs.
The Pharmacare Act proposes the foundational principles for the first phase of national universal
pharmacare in Canada and describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces
and territories (PTs) to provide universal, single-payer coveragefor a number of contraception and
diabetes medications, to help Canadians access the drugs they need, especially those who face
the greatest barriers.
This legislation is an important step forward to improve health equity, affordability, and outcomes
and has the potential of long-term savings to the health care system.
Coverage for contraceptives will mean that 9 million Canadians of reproductive age will have better
access to contraception and reproductive autonomy, reducing the risk of unintended pregnancies
and improving their ability to plan for the future. Cost hasconsistently been identified as the single
most important barrier to access to these medications and the cost is unevenly borne by women
and gender diverse Canadians. Bill C-64 will ensure that Canadians will have access to a suite of
contraceptive drugs and devices.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Diabetes is a complex disease that has no cure but can be treated with safe and effective
medications. One in four Canadians with diabetes have reported not following their treatment plan
due to cost. Improving access to diabetes medications will help improve the health of 3.7 million
Canadians living with diabetes and reduce the risk of serious life-changing health complications
such as blindness or amputations.
BACKGROUND
Women and gender diverse people, seniors, persons with disabilities, persons with chronic
diseases, 2SLGBTQI+ populations, racialized communities, and those living in rural or remote
communities are disproportionality impacted by Canada’s current patchworkapproach to drug
coverage, especially if they are from a low-income household.
Historically, these populations have demonstrated higher rates of cost-related non-adherence. This
means they are taking less medication than prescribed because of cost, such as delaying or failing
to fill prescriptions, or skipping or lowering medicationdoses.
Factors associated with cost-related non-adherence include high out-of-pocket drug spending, low
income or financial flexibility, lack of drug insurance, younger age, and poorer health.
A 2022 report by Statistics Canada looking at the impact of the pandemic on pharmaceutical
access and use found the percentages of people reporting not having prescription insurance to
cover drug costs was higher among immigrants (29%) relative to non-immigrants (17%) and among
racialized persons (29%) relative to non racialized and non-Indigenous persons (17%).
According to the Canadian Survey on Disabilities, 13% of all persons with disabilities aged 15 years
and over had unmet needs for prescription drug due to cost. Unmet need for an aid, device, and/or
prescription drug to cost was higher among those of working age (28.6%) than over the age of 65, as
well as among those with more severe disabilities (37.4%).
Overall, individuals with precarious work (i.e., part-time employment) tend to not have access to
private drug coverage through their employer. As a result, they may have to pay for prescription
drugs 100% out-of-pocket if they are not eligible for a public drug plan (most public plans support
catastrophic costs and select populations like seniors and children). Furthermore, patient charges
(e.g., premiums, copays, deductibles, and plan maximums) under existing public and private plans
can result in high out-of-pocket costs that may make the drugs they need inaccessible.
Contraception
Some populations are disproportionally affected by the lack of coverage. Women, people with low
incomes and young people, all of whom are all more likely to work in part-time or contract
positions, often lack access to private coverage. One study found that women and girls from lower-
income households are more likely to use less-effective contraceptive methods or no contraceptive
method.
Diabetes
Diabetes disproportionately affects certain populations within Canada. Evidence shows that First
Nations and Métis people, and people of African, East Asian and South Asian ethnic backgrounds
have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes compared to the general population.
6.PHARMACARE
Impact of the Pharmacare Act on Indigenous Peoples, governments and organizations
KEY FACTS
The Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program provides coverage for a range of medically
necessary benefits, including comprehensive drug coverage, to over 900,000 registered First
Nations and recognized Inuit.
The Pharmacare Act does not affect the NIHB program or the amount of funding provided to
Indigenous governments and organizations.
NIHB recipients will continue to have access to the robust drug coverage.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Bill C-64 commits the Government of Canada to engage and collaborate with Indigenous Peoples
on the implementation of national universal pharmacare.
KEY MESSAGES
The Government of Canada is committed to working together with Indigenous partners and
communities across the country to advancepriorities that promote and protect health, including
drug coverage.
The Pharmacare Act will not affect the Non-Insured Health Benefits program delivered by
Indigenous Services Canada. Recipients will continue to have access to the robust drug coverage.
All the contraception and diabetes medications listed for discussion with provinces and territories
are included on the NIHB formulary and are provided at no cost to NIHB recipients.
The Government of Canada recognizes the unique relationships that provinces and territories have
with Indigenous Peoples and representative organizations within each jurisdiction. Therefore, we
will work with provinces and territories to ensure that an approach for meaningful engagement with
Indigenous Peoples and representative organizations is appropriately reflected in bilateral
agreements.
BACKGROUND
First Nations and Inuit that receive drug coverage through the Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB)
will experience no changes from the bill. Non-status, urban and off-reserve First Nations and Métis
are covered through PT and/or private plans, like all Canadians. Individuals could benefit from the
universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications, as
outlined in Bill C-64.
Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program
The Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program provides coverage for a range of medically
necessary benefits to over 900,000 registered First Nations and recognized Inuit. All registered First
Nations and recognized Inuit areeligible for NIHB benefits, regardless of location or income level,
unless otherwise covered under a separate agreement with federal or provincial governments, or
through a separate self-government agreement.
As the NIHB program is provided only to First Nations and Inuit registered under the Indian Act and
their children under 18 months, the program captures around half with an Indigenous identity.
The NIHB program covers a comprehensive range of prescription drugs and over-the-counter
medications listed on the NIHB Drug Benefit List (DBL). Prescription and over-the-counter
medications are evidence-based and covered in accordance with program policies.
In 2021 to 2022, the NIHB program paid for pharmacy claims made by a total of 528,541 First
Nations and Inuit clients. The total spent for these claims was $576.3 million or 34.0% of total NIHB
expenditures. Of all the NIHB program benefits, the pharmacy benefit is the benefit most utilized by
clients and accounts for the second largest share ofexpenditures.
7.PHARMACARE
The federal role in implementing national pharmacare, in light of provincial and territorial (PT)
jurisdiction over health care delivery.
KEY FACTS
The management of prescription drugs is a shared responsibility in Canada.
The federal government is responsible for assessing the safety, efficacy and quality of drugs before
authorizing them for sale in Canada.
Provincial and territorial governments are responsible for the delivery of health care for their
residents, including determining which drugs are covered under government-run public plans,
under what conditions this coverage is offered, and which populations are eligible for this coverage.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Bill C-64 outlines the Government of Canada’s plan to ensure universal, single-payer coverage for a
range of contraception and diabetes medications. This includes the Government of Canada’s
intention to establish a fund for diabetes devices to help support Canadians manage and monitor
their diabetes and administer their medication.
The Government of Canada will work with willing provinces and territories to implement this
coverage through bilateral agreements.
KEY MESSAGES
Bill C-64 recognizes and emphasises the role of the provinces and territories in health care delivery
in Canada and sets out a collaborative, principles based, step-by-step path towards national
universal pharmacare.
The Bill outlines the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and territories (PTs) to
provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications.
In order to receive federal funding to provide universal, single-payer coverage for contraception and
diabetes medications, a bilateral agreement would need to be made between the Government of
Canada and a willing province or territory.
The Bill demonstrates the Government of Canada’s commitment to consulting widely about the
way forward and working with provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples and other partners and
stakeholders.
BACKGROUND
PT Drug Plans
In total, there are more than 100 government-run drug coverage plans in Canada. These plans are
based on a variety of distinct coverage models (e.g., comprehensive coverage for low-income
seniors, income-based safety net coverage, voluntary premium-based coverage). There is generally
good alignment with regard to the list of drugs eligible for coverage across public drug plans
country-wide. But how much Canadians are required to pay out-of-pocket under these plans varies
significantly within and between jurisdictions.
PTsprovide coverage with minimal/no patient charges for certain vulnerable groups, such as lower-
income seniors and people on social assistance. All provinces (but none of the territories) also have
a form of safety net coverage to protect residents from high (“catastrophic”) drug costs relative to
income. These “catastrophic” plans have deductibles (3-20% of household income) or premiums.
While protective against truly catastrophic costs, they offer little support for routine drug expenses.
Improving Affordable Access to Prescription Drugs in Prince Edward Island
Since 2021, the federal government has been working with the Government of Prince Edward Island
(PEI) on a demonstration initiative to improve affordable access to medications for Island residents
with an investment of $35 million. Through this partnership, PEI has improved affordability by
reducing copays to $5 for some common medications, expanded eligibility to their High Cost Drug
Program by removing barriers for those in the lowest income brackets and making the program
available to all income levels,and adjusting the Catastrophic Drug Program to lower the cap on the
amount of money a household spends on eligible medications. The province has also expanded
access to 85 new medications and removed administrative barriers to 23 medications.
PEI reached out to the federal government to signal its interest in collaborating to improve
accessibility and affordability of their public drugs plans. At the time, PEI’s formulary listed the
lowest number of drugs in the country, resulting in less access to drugs for Islanders compared to
the rest of Canada. Island residents also faced some of Canada’s highest co-pays and deductibles
for drugs covered on their public plans. The province was also already in the process of reviewing its
public drug plans to determine how best to simplify its complex set of plans to make them more
affordable and comparable to other provinces.
Federal Drug Coverage
The federal government provides drug coverage with minimal/no patient charges to approximately
1.2 million Canadians who are part of selected federal populations (i.e., registered First Nations
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
and recognized Inuit populations, federal inmates, members of the Canadian forces, veterans,
resettled refugees and refugee claimants).
The largest federal drug plan is part of the Non-Insured Health Benefits (NIHB) Program run by
Indigenous Services Canada, which provides over 900,000 registered First Nations and recognized
Inuit with coverage for a range of medical services not covered by other plans and programs. The
NIHB drug plan provides beneficiaries with coverage for a comprehensive list of drugs (including
essential medicines) with no deductibles or copayments.

Fiscal implications of an Act respecting pharmacare
KEY FACTS
Bill C-64 outlines the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and territories (PTs) to
provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications.
This includes the Government of Canada’s intention to establish a fund for diabetes devices to help
support Canadians manage and monitor their diabetes and administer their medication.
Federal funding to provinces and territories for the provision of universal, single payer coverage for a
range of contraception and diabetes medications will be provided through bilateral agreements.
The Bill also commits the Government of Canada to maintaining long-term funding for the
provinces, territories and Indigenous Peoples to improve theaccessibility and affordability of
pharmaceutical products, beginning with those for rare diseases.
Budget 2024 includes a commitment of $1.5 billion over 5 years to support the launch of national
pharmacare and coverage for contraception and diabetes medications.
KEY MESSAGES
When Canadians do not fill their prescriptions for financial reasons, their health may worsen, which
can lead to increased use of the health care system and increased health care costs.
The Pharmacare Act proposes the foundational principles for the first phase of national universal
pharmacare in Canada and describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces
and territories (PTs) to provide universal, single-payer coveragefor a number of contraception and
diabetes medications, to help Canadians access the drugs they need.
In order to receive federal funding to provide universal, single-payer coverage for contraception and
diabetes medications, a bilateral agreement would need to be made between the Government of
Canada and a willing province or territory. The intent of thisfunding would be to enhance, rather

All costing will be contingent on the outcome of discussions with provinces and territories,
beginning with the provision of universal, single payer for a range of contraception and diabetes
medications as identified in the lists provided in the backgrounders to the news release.
The Bill also commits to maintaining long-term funding for the provinces, territories and Indigenous
peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical products, beginning with
those for rare diseases.
To help carry out this work, in Budget 2024 the Government of Canada announced $1.5 billion over
5 years to support the launch of national pharmacare and coverage for contraception and diabetes
medications.
This Bill represents a major milestone for the Government of Canada, confirming its commitment to
work with provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples and other partners towards a universal national
pharmacare program.
BACKGROUND
Estimates for the cost of implementing national universal pharmacare vary. Factors influencing the
incremental public cost include the scope of drugs covered, the magnitude of cost-sharing with
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
patients (i.e. premiums, deductibles, copays) and the degree of cost-shifting from private to public
payers.
The 2019 Hoskins report estimated the cost to implement universal single-payer public
pharmacare would be $3.5 billion in 2022 (for an initial list of approximately 125 drugs), rising to
$15.3 billion at full implementation in 2027 (for a comprehensive national formulary of
approximately 900 drugs).
Contraception
Studies have demonstrated that publicly funded no-cost universal contraception can result in
public cost savings. Evidence from the University of British Columbia (BC) estimated that no-cost
contraception has the potential to save the BC health care systemapproximately $27 million per
year.
Diabetes
Uncontrolled diabetes can have very serious short and long-term health impacts and represents a
burden to individuals, families, and Canadian society. High and unnecessary costs are incurred
from lost productivity and elevated health-care system use due todiabetes and its complications,
including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness and amputation. The full cost of diabetes to
the healthcare system in 2018 is estimated to be around $27 billion and could exceed $39 billion by
2028.
Federal Investments in Pharmacare
On December 18, 2023 the Government of Canada announced the creation of the Canadian Drug
Agency (CDA). The CDA will be built from the existing Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies
in Health (CADTH) and in partnership with provinces and territories (PTs). The Government of
Canada is investing $89.5 million over five years to establish the CDA.
The CDA will incorporate and expand on CADTH's expertise in the pharmaceutical sector, including
its strong leadership and technical proficiency. The CDA will build on CADTH's existing mandate
and functions (health technology assessment, post-market safetyand effectiveness) and expand
them to include new work streams including:
Improving the appropriate prescribing and use of medications, for better patient health and to
support system sustainability;
Increasing pan-Canadian data collection and expanding access to drug and treatment data,
including real-world evidence data, to better support patients, inform health decisions and enable
robust system data analytics; and
Reducing drug system duplication and lack of coordination that causes expensive inefficiencies
and pressures.
The Government will work with CADTH and PTs to develop the CDA. Once the CDA is operational, it
will take on a greater role in the drug system to ensure Canadians can have better health outcomes
and access the medications they need now and into the future.
In March 2023, the Minister of Health announced the launch of the first phase of the national
strategy for drugs for rare diseases with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three years, to
improve access to treatments for people living with a rare disease. As part of this first phase, the
Government of Canada will provide up to:
$1.4 billion over three years to provinces and territories through bilateral agreements.
$33 million over three years to Indigenous Services Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program
to support eligible First Nations and Inuit clients with rare diseases.
$20 million over three years to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health and the
Canadian Institute for Health Information to improve the collection and use of evidence to support
decision-making.
$32 million over five years to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to advance a rare disease
research agenda

National formulary and national bulk purchasing strategy KEY FACTS
Bill C-64 outlines next steps toward the development of a national formulary and a national bulk
purchasing strategy, both of which will serve as important foundational elements of national
pharmacare.
A ‘formulary’ is a list of drugs and related products that are eligible for coverage under a drug plan.
A national formulary would outline the scope of prescription drugs and related products Canadians
should have access to under national universal pharmacare and would inform work toward a bulk
purchasing strategy.
Through the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA), provinces and territories have already
realized benefits from coordinated negotiations to achieve greater value for publicly funded drug
programs and patients.
The Minister must request that the CDA prepare a preliminary list of prescription drugs and related
products to inform the development of a national formulary and collaborate with partners and
stakeholders to develop a national bulk purchasing strategy aligned with the principles set out in
the Pharmacare Act.
KEY MESSAGES
A national formulary and a national bulk purchasing strategy for prescription drugs and related
products will serve as important foundational elements of nationalpharmacare.
To that end, the Bill C-64 sets out that the Minister of Health must request that the Canadian Drug
Agency (CDA) prepare a preliminary list of prescription drugs and related products to inform the
development of a national formulary. The Minister must alsorequest that the CDA develop a
national bulk purchasing strategy. National Formulary
Bill C-64 describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and territories to
provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications.
A preliminary list of these two groups of medications has been prepared and will form an important
part of a national formulary once it is developed by the Canadian Drug Agency.
National Bulk Purchasing Strategy
Thebenefits of bulk purchasing have already been shown in Canada by the pan-Canadian
Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) since 2010. As of April 1, 2023 savings from pCPA activities to
participating public drug plans are estimated to be $3.89 Billion annually.
A national bulk purchasing strategy developed by the Canadian Drug Agency, in collaboration with
partners and stakeholders, would build from the existing work of the pCPA. Once subsequently
agreed with partners and implemented, this strategy could furtherhelp lower the prices and
increase the availability of prescription drugs and related products that will be covered under
pharmacare agreements.
BACKGROUND
In 2019, the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare, chaired by Dr. Eric
Hoskins, recommended the implementation of universal national pharmacare. The Council
proposed coverage be phased-in starting with a list of essential medicines to be expanded over
time to become a comprehensive drug list (national formulary).
Guided by the Council’s work, Budget 2019 announced funding for a number of foundational steps
toward national pharmacare, including the development of a national formulary. Subsequently,
Budget 2022 committed to continue progress toward national pharmacare by tabling a Pharmacare
Act and then tasking the Canadian Drug Agency to develop a national formulary of essential
medicines and a bulk purchasing plan.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Preliminary work toward a national formulary has been completed. In June 2022, a multidisciplinary
advisory panel convened by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH) at
the request of Health Canada recommended principles and a process for developing a national
formulary.
As a test case for its proposed process, the panel also developed a sample list of commonly
prescribed drugs and related products for three therapeutic areas with a high volume of drug use in
Canada: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and mental illness.
The Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare suggested that with national
pharmacare, estimated system-wide savings would be modest at first ($0.3 billion in 2022) rising to
almost $5 billion annually once pharmacare is fully implemented with a comprehensive formulary.
The Parliamentary Budgeting Officer, in their 2023 report on the cost of single-payer universal
pharmacare, estimate that the price of all existing drugs under a common formulary could be
negotiated down to the current lowest observable price in Canada. This contributes to their
projected economy-wide savings of up to $2.2 billion.

Stakeholders want to see progress on national pharmacare, but have differing visions of the end

In general, patients, health care professionals, and labour organizations are supportive of a
“medicare” (public single-payer) approach, while the insurance and pharmaceutical industries
advocate a “fill the gaps” (mixed-payer) approach that would extend public coverage to those who
need it most while maintaining existing private plans.
The majority of stakeholders that envision a “medicare” approach have expressed support for Bill
C-64 given the provision outlining the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and
territories (PTs) to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and
diabetes medications.
Pharmacy stakeholders have expressed concern on implementing single-payer public coverage and
how that might impact their dispensing fees as well as the potential for disruptions in their ability to
provide professional services to patients/clients who areswitching from private to public coverage
for these medications.
A phased approach to implementation of coverage improvements is generally supported by all
stakeholders.
There have been no new pharmacare statements from Indigenous groups since 2019. The last
known positions taken by Indigenous peoples or organisations include expressed interest in
continuing a dialogue on national pharmacare by Indigenous participants during engagemen
conducted by the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare (the Advisory
Council), chaired by Dr. Eric Hoskins. Additionally, in 2019, the Assembly of First Nations made a
public statement that was not supportive of national pharmacare, as it infringes upon their
Medicine Chest Treaty rights. Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Métis National Council have not identified
pharmacare as a priority. The Government of Canada provides drug coverage for registered First
Nations and recognized Inuit through its Non-Insured HealthBenefits (NIHB) Program. Changes to
that program are not being proposed under this legislation.
KEY MESSAGES
The Bill demonstrates the Government of Canada’s commitment to consulting widely about the
way forward and working with provinces, territories, Indigenous peoples and other partners and
stakeholders.
Organizations representing patients (Diabetes Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation), health care
professionals (Canadian Medical Association) and labour organizations (Canadian Labour
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Congress) have expressed general support for Bill C-64 due to the provision outlining the
Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces and territories (PTs) to provide universal,
single-payer coverage for a number of contraception and diabetes medications.
We believe all stakeholders, regardless of their preferred model of pharmacare, agree on the
importance of improving the affordability, accessibility and appropriate use of prescription drugs
forall Canadians, as reflected in the four principles outlined in the Bill.
The Government of Canada will continue to maintain open and transparent communication with all
stakeholders as the legislation moves forward.
BACKGROUND
Organizations representing patients (Diabetes Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation), health care
professionals (Canadian Medical Association) and labour organizations (Canadian Labour
Congress) have consistently expressed their support for the recommendations of a universal,
single-payer, public model as outlined in the 2019 report by the Advisory Council. Therefore, these
groups have expressed general support for Bill C-64 given reference to universal, single-payer
coverage for a range of contraception anddiabetes medications.
Most pharmaceutical and insurance industry groups, which advocate for a “fill the gaps” (mixed-
payer) approach, have not expressed support of the Bill given reference to universal, single-payer
coverage for a range of contraception and diabetes medications.
Industry groups such as Canadian Generic Pharmaceutical Association (CGPA) and Biosimilars
Canada have taken a more neutral position as they seek to learn more about the Government of
Canada’s approach to implementation, particularly related to the role ofgeneric and biosimilar
medicines in the context of cost-savings.
During the Advisory Council’s engagement with Indigenous partners, participants expressed an
interest in continuing a dialogue on national pharmacare. In July 2019, the Assembly of First
Nations made a public statement that was not supportive of national pharmacare, as it infringes
upon their Medicine Chest Treaty rights, and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Métis National Council have
not identified pharmacare as a priority.
11.PHARMACARE
Uninsured and underinsured Canadians KEY FACTS
Millions of Canadians are underinsured. In 2021, Statistics Canada found that more than one in
every five (21%) adults in Canada reported not having the insurance they needed to cover
prescription drug costs.
Although all provinces have catastrophic drug plans, deductibles under these plans can be up to
20% of net family income. In many cases, Canadians will never reach the deductible, leaving them
without support for their drug costs.
Statistics Canada found that in 2021 close to one in five (18%) Canadians spent $500 or more out of
pocket for their prescription medication and one in ten (9%) reported not adhering to their
prescription medication because of costs.
This can have serious consequences for individuals and their families, and result in additional costs
to the health care system.
KEY MESSAGES
No Canadian should be in a position where they must choose between the prescription drugs they
need for their health and well-being and putting food on the table.
Underinsurance can have serious consequences. Many Canadians with high out-of-pocket
medication costs report foregoing essential needs, such as food and heat, or not adhering to their
prescriptions due to costs.
When people do not take their prescription drugs the way they are supposed to, their health can
suffer. This results in serious consequences for the individual and their household, and
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
unnecessary costs to the health care system as patients are more likely to visit an emergency room
or be admitted to hospital.
The Pharmacare Act proposes the foundational principles for the first phase of national universal
pharmacare in Canada and describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with provinces
and territories to provide universal, single-payer coverage for anumber of contraception and
diabetes medications, to help Canadians access the drugs they need, especially those who face
the greatest barriers.
This legislation is an important step forward to improve health equity, affordability, and outcomes
and has the potential of long-term savings to the health care system.
Coverage for contraceptives will mean that 9 million Canadians of reproductive age will have better
access to contraception and reproductive autonomy, reducing the risk of unintended pregnancies
and improving their ability to plan for the future. Cost hasconsistently been identified as the single
most important barrier to access to these medications and the cost is unevenly borne by women
and gender diverse Canadians. Bill C-64 will ensure that Canadians will have access to a suite of
contraceptive drugs and devices.
Diabetes is a complex disease that has no cure but can be treated with safe and effective
medications. One in four Canadians with diabetes have reported not following their treatment plan
due to cost. Improving access to diabetes medications will help improve the health of 3.7 million
Canadians living with diabetes and reduce the risk of serious life-changing health complications
such as blindness or amputations.
BACKGROUND
When Medicare was first introduced, prescription drugs outside of hospital cost less and played a
smaller role in health care. But today, prescription drugs are a central part of our health, helping to
control chronic conditions, treat temporary ones, andaid in overall health and well-being.
Outside of hospital, prescription drug coverage comes from a mix of private insurance, out-of-
pocket cash payments, and various provincial programs.
Although most Canadians have some form of drug coverage, this does not mean that those with
insurance have access to the prescription drugs they need. In 2021, Statistics Canada found that
more than one in every five (21%) adults in Canada reported not having the insurance they needed
to cover prescription drug costs.
All provinces have drug coverage to protect Canadians from catastrophic drug costs, but
deductibles under these plans can range from 0 to 20% of net family income. In many cases,
Canadians will never reach the deductible, leaving them without support for their drug costs.
Lower-income Canadians make up a disproportionate share of the underinsured. While most
provinces have put in place drug coverage for those accessing social assistance benefits, a gap
persists. Many lower-income households that do not qualify for social assistance continue to
struggle with out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. Underinsurance can be a particular concern for
young adults who ‘age-out’ of their parent’s private insurance, but do not have their own form of
private coverage.
Statistics Canada found that in 2021 close to one in five (18%) Canadians spent $500 or more out of
pocket for their prescription medication and one in ten (9%) reported not adhering to their
prescription medication because of costs. This includes delayingfilling prescriptions or skipping
doses to contain costs.
Contraception
Cost has been identified by Canadian contraceptive care providers as the single most important
barrier to access to these medications. Oral contraceptives cost approximately $25 perunit, or
$300 per year. Intrauterine Devices (IUDs), which are effective for five years, cost approximately up
to $500 per unit.
Cost can discourage people both from accessing contraception, and from choosing more effective
methods of contraception with a higher upfront cost. For example, oral contraceptives have a
typical use failure rate of 9% compared to 0.20% for IUDs. Not having affordable access to effective
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
contraception can increase the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can impact life plans such
as going to school and advancing in one's career.
Diabetes
In 2015, 25% of Canadians with diabetes indicated following their treatments were affected by
cost, in some cases rationing medications to save money. Uncontrolled diabetes can have very
serious short and long-term health impacts and represents a burden to individuals, families, and
Canadian society. High and unnecessary costs are incurred from lost productivity and elevated
health-care system use due to diabetes and its complications, including heart attack, stroke,
kidney failure, blindness and amputation.
12.DRUGS FOR RARE DISEASES ISSUE
Rare diseases are often chronic, can be seriously debilitating and potentially life-threatening. With
few or no treatment options, available treatments can be high-cost, which poses significant
challenges to patients, caregivers, and the health care system, including the sustainability of public
and private drug plans that pay for these drugs.
KEY FACTS
Rare diseases are life-threatening, seriously debilitating and sometimes chronic in nature. They are
often genetic conditions, with onset either at birth or early childhood.
Currently, Canadians with rare diseases access the drugs they need through government drug
plans, through private drug plans, or by paying out of pocket. Many drugs for rare diseases are very
expensive and patients generally cannot afford to pay by themselves.
The 2019 Final Report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare
recommended for the Canadian government to develop a formal National Strategy for Drugs for
Rare Diseases.
Bill C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare, commits to maintaining long-term funding for provinces,
territories and Indigenous Peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical
products, beginning with the funding announced for the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare
Diseases.
KEY MESSAGES
On March 22, 2023, the Government of Canada announced measures in support of the first-ever
National Strategy for Drugs for Rare Diseases, with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three
years.
We are implementing this Strategy by working with provinces and territories towards the
development of bilateral agreements. Funding for the bilateral agreements will be available April 1,
2024 and run until March 31, 2027.
These bilateral agreements will help increase access and improve affordability of effective drugs for
rare diseases to improve the health of patients across Canada.
Further, funding to the Canadian Institutes for Health Information (CIHI) and Canadian Agency for
Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) is improving the collection and use of evidence to
support decision-making.
Funding to the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is advancing rare disease research.
IF PRESSED ON DETAILS ON PROGRESS OF BILATERAL AGREEMENTS
Discussions with provinces and territories are underway to jointly determine a small set of new and
emerging drugs, which will be cost-shared and covered in a consistent way across Canada, for the
benefit of patients.
Funding for the bilateral agreements with willing provinces and territories will start on April 1, 2024
and run for three years until March 31, 2027.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Funding has also gone to support eligible First Nations and Inuit patients living with rare diseases,
through Indigenous Services Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.
IF PRESSED ON HOW 2023-24 BILATERAL AGREEMENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT
Funding for the bilateral agreements with willing provinces and territories will start on April 1, 2024
and run for three years until March 31, 2027.
IF PRESSED ON QUEBEC’S PARTICIPATION IN THE NATIONAL STRATEGY
Our Government is working with all provinces and territories to help increase access to, and
affordability of, promising and effective drugs for rare diseases to improve the health of patients
across Canada, while also providing flexibility for jurisdictions to address their own unique
circumstances.
All provinces and territories have been invited to engage all steps in the implementation of the
Strategy, including jointly determining a small set of new and emerging drugs that would be cost-
shared and covered in a consistent way.They have also been engaged to share in the other pillars of
the Strategy: the benefits ofcollaborative approaches to the collection and use of evidence and
innovation and research.
IF PRESSED ON DETAILS ON STAKEHOLDER CONSULTATION THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION
ADVISORY GROUP
An Implementation Advisory Group was launched in October 2023 to support the implementation
of the National Strategy from a patient-centered perspective and to help improve consistent access
and affordability of effective drugs for rare diseases across the country.
The Implementation Advisory Group is comprised of individuals drawn from a range of perspectives
and roles, including patients, caregivers, clinicians, and industry.
IF PRESSED ON FUNDING TO HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS
We are working with our partners, including the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in
Health (CADTH), the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), and the Canadian Institutes
of Health Research (CIHR) to focus on collection and use of evidence to support decision making
and to advance rare disease research.
For example, CADTH’s new newborn screening expertpanel will develop guidance to foster greater
consistency and timelier access to treatments.
CIHR is providing $20M over 5 years to the Maternal Infant Child and Youth Research Network
(MICYRN) to build a National Pediatric Rare Disease ClinicalTrials and Treatment Network.
IF PRESSED ON WHEN PATIENTS WILL SEE BENEFITS FROM THE STRATEGY
Funding for the bilateral agreements with willing provinces and territories will start on April 1, 2024
and run for three years until March 31, 2027
Funding to health system partners has already begun, and is now helping to improve the collection
and use of evidence to support decision-making, and advancing rare disease research and
treatment networks.
IF PRESSED ON HOW THE STRATEGY IS ALIGNED WITH THE PHARMACARE ACT
Bill C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare, commits to maintaining long-term funding for provinces,
territories and Indigenous Peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical
products, beginning with the funding announced for the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare
Diseases.
The National Strategy is intended to be part of continuing progress towards national universal
pharmacare and is a concrete expression of the principles set out in the pharmacare bill.
Through the National Strategy we are addressing the issue of access and universal coverage by
addressing the issue of the “postal code lottery” for DRD identified in national consultations. We
are also focusing on affordability and high costs of DRD that leave patients financially vulnerable,
and addressing appropriate use through supporting improvements in the use and generation of real
world evidence.

BACKGROUND
CANADIANS LIVING WITH RARE DISEASES
Rare diseases are life-threatening, seriously debilitating and sometimes chronic in nature. They are
often genetic conditions, with onset either at birth or early childhood.
Rare diseases are not rare as a group: it is estimated there are between 6,000 and 8,000 in the
world. They are considered rare because they each affect small numbers of people, ranging from a
handful of individuals to a few thousand. It is estimated that one out of twelve Canadians has a rare
disease.
DRUGS FOR RARE DISEASES
Patients with rare diseases generally have few treatment options, resulting in unmet clinical need.
Accordingly, treatments are in high demand and can be high-cost. Treatments for rare diseases are
often referred to as orphan drugs, or expensive drugs forrare diseases, or drugs for rare diseases.
High prices are often attributed to factors such as the high cost of research, limited number of
patients, small market size, and lack of competitors.
The Government of Canada is working with Provinces and Territories as an active member of the
pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) to combine the governments’ collective buying
power to negotiate lower prices on brand name drugs for all public plans, including drugs for rare
diseases.
ACCESS TO DRUGS FOR RARE DISEASES
Currently, Canadians with rare diseases can access the drugs they need through government drug
plans, through private drug plans, or by paying out of pocket. Because these drugs are so expensive,
patients generally cannot afford to pay by themselves.
Canadians have been able to gain access to drugs for rare diseases through participation in clinical
trials, or as drugs are approved under Division 8 of the Food and Drug Regulations. In cases where
criteria are met, Health Canada’s Special Access Program(SAP) considers requests for access to
drugs that are unavailable for sale in Canada. About 150 of the drugs accessed through the SAP are
for the treatment of rare diseases.
LAUNCH OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DRUGS FOR RARE DISEASES
The Minister of Health announced the launch of the first phase of the National Strategy for Drugs for
Rare Diseases on March 22, 2023, with an investment of up to $1.5 billion over three years, to
improve access to treatments for people living with a rare disease.
As part of this first phase, the Government of Canada will provide up to $1.4 billion over three years
to provinces and territories through bilateral agreements. This federal investment will increase
access to safe and effective drugs for Canadians with rare diseases. Provinces and territories will
be able to add new drugs to their formularies and increase coverage of existing drugs. The new
funding will also enable provinces and territories to improve screening and diagnostics so that
patients with a raredisease have a better chance of getting access to effective treatments at the
right time, which can mean significantly better health and overall quality of life for patients and their
families.
In addition, the Government of Canada is providing up to $33 million over three years to Indigenous
Services Canada’s Non-Insured Health Benefits Program to support eligible First Nations and Inuit
clients with rare diseases.
The Government of Canada is also making key investments of up to $68 million to support
collaborative governance, data infrastructure, and research for drugs for rare diseases. $20 million
over three years is being provided to the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health and
the Canadian Institute for Health Information to improvethe collection and use of evidence to
support decision-making. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research are receiving $32 million over
five years to advance a rare disease research agenda with a focus on developing better diagnostic
tools and establishing a robust Canadian rare disease clinical trials network. $16 million over three
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
years, starting in 2023, is being invested to support the establishment of national governance
structures, such as a Health Canada secretariat and a stakeholder Implementation Advisory Group.
The Government of Canada will continue working with provinces and territories, health system
partners, and stakeholders, including patients, families, and clinicians, to develop future actions
based on lessons learned as part of these actions included in the first phase of the Strategy.
NATIONAL PHARMACARE LEGISLATION
The 2019 Final Report of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare
recommended for the Canadian government to develop a formal National Strategy for Drugs for
Rare Diseases.
Budget 2019 announced federal investments to moveforward on a number of foundational
elements of national pharmacare, including the creation of the National Strategy, as well as the
development of a national formulary, and the creation of the Canadian Drug Agency.
The National Strategy is intended to be part of continuing progress towards a national universal
pharmacare program. It continues to be a crucial part of the government’s commitment to long-
term funding to improve the accessibility and affordability of drugs.
Bill C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare, commits to maintaining long-term funding for provinces,
territories and Indigenous Peoples to improve the accessibility and affordability of pharmaceutical
products, beginning with the funding announced for the National Strategy for Drugs for Rare
Diseases.
13.PAN-CANADIAN APPROPRIATE USE STRATEGY ISSUE
In Canada, over 750 million prescriptions worth $38.9B are written annually. However, there is no
coordinated national approach to provide guidance and support to prescribers and patients on
their safe and effective use. A growing body of evidence suggeststhat prescribing is often
suboptimal, threatening patient safety and leading to significant negative health, social, and
financial impacts on patients and the health system. This issue disproportionally impacts
vulnerable populations (e.g., seniors, racialized communities).
Nearly 2 million seniors in Canada regularly take at least one potentially inappropriate medication
that can lead to harms such as falls, memory problems, hospitalizations or even death. It is
estimated that annually $419 million is spent in direct costs for these medications, which rises to
$1.4 billion if the health care costs to treat harmful effects are included.
Broad engagement with provinces, territories, health organizations, and system partners to develop
a plan for the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA) identified the need to enhance the appropriate use of
pharmaceuticals to improve safety, health outcomes and support prescribers and patients.
Developing a coordinated approach to address appropriate use, one that better supports patients
and prescribers in choosing the best treatments for their care, is an important part of the new
pharmacare legislation. The bill commits the Minister of Healthto publishing a pan-Canadian
strategy for appropriate use and to requesting the Canadian Drug Agency report on its progress.
KEY MESSAGES
Almost $38.9 billion worth of prescriptions are written annually in Canada and yet patients
outcomes are not optimal. It is time for us to develop apan-Canadian appropriate use strategy to
help ensure medications bring true improvements to patient health and safety, and limiting
additional burdens to patients and costs to the health care system.
Provinces and territories, health partners and patients agree that addressing appropriate
prescribing and use should be a focus for the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA). The Strategy will
improve supports for prescribers and patients to make informed decisions regarding optimal
treatments for their care.
In March 2023, we started moving forward with this work by establishing an Appropriate Use
Advisory Committee to provide guidance and recommendations for the development of the
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Strategy and eventual program for a CDA. The Committee’s final report and recommendations are
expected this Spring.
A coordinated, national approach to appropriate use, guided by the CDA, is an important element
of moving forward with national pharmacare by supporting the prescribing and use of medications
to improve the health of people living in Canada.
BACKGROUND
Appropriate Use In Canada
Improving access to pharmaceuticals and the appropriate use of drugs has been a shared priority
of federal, provincial and territorial governments since 2016. However, there is currently no
coordinated strategy or approach for the design, implementation or evaluation of initiatives, and no
centralized organization promoting its importance in patient health and safety. Instead,
jurisdictions, pan-Canadian health organizations and non-governmental organizations have
implemented a variety of independent projects. These include:
Academic detailing, one-on-one clinician education, by trained health care professionals, to
provide evidence-based information to improve the appropriate use of medications.
Provincial/territorial prescription drug monitoring programs for controlled prescription drugs such
as opioids to ensure their safe prescribing and use.
Educational tools and resources for patients and prescribers such as doctors, pharmacists, and
nurse practitioners.
Audits and feedback programs for clinicians where they receive personalized information about
their prescribing.
While this patchwork of initiatives demonstrate progress, the lack of a national strategy for the
design, implementation and evaluation of initiatives means their reach and impact is limited and
uncoordinated. This leads to duplication of efforts, gaps inservices, misallocation of scare
resources and can accentuate variations in prescribing and use across jurisdictions.
International Comparison
Several Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries have
implemented nationally coordinated appropriate use strategies and programs that have effectively
improved health outcomes and delivered cost savings due to hospital avoidance. These include
Australia’s Quality Use of Medications Strategy, the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence, and the Dutch Institute for Rational Use of Medicine in the Netherlands and
others.
Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare
Budget 2018 announced the creation of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National
Pharmacare, chaired by Dr. Eric Hoskins.
The Council engaged with Canadians, patients, provincial, territorial, and Indigenous leaders,
health care experts, and stakeholders through regional roundtables, town halls, an online
questionnaire, and written submissions.
On June 12, 2019, the Council’s final report was tabled in Parliament, recommending the
implementation of national universal pharmacare over several years, including FPT collaboration to
create a new arms-length Canadian Drug Agency (CDA) that would be responsible for providing
guidance on the appropriate use of drugs and monitoring their safe and effective use once on the
market.
The report recommended that the CDA create and implement a national strategy on appropriate
prescribing to support patients and prescribers understand pharmaceutical treatment choices.
Canadian Drug Agency Transition Office
Canadian Drug AgencyTransition Office (CDTAO) was formally established in spring 2021 to work
with provinces and territories (PTs) and stakeholders, conduct analysis, and develop options to
advance a CDA; supported by a $35 million investment (Budget 2019).
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
The CDATO has received insights from patients, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, prescribers
and academics and many others through over 400 meetings and roundtables.
Enhancing efforts to address appropriate use of medications was one of the priority areas identified
by PTs and stakeholders to improve health outcomes and support system sustainability.
On December 18, 2023, the Government of Canada announced its plan to advance with the
establishment of the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA, the Agency), with appropriate use as one of its
priorities. The Government of Canada is investing $89.5 million over fiveyears to establish the CDA,
in addition to the existing federal funding of $34.2 million annually to support CADTH.
Appropriate Use Advisory Committee
In March 2023, the CDATO established an Appropriate Use Advisory Committee to provide advice
and guidance to the CDATO for the development of a pan-Canadian Appropriate Use Strategy and a
corresponding program for the CDA.
The Advisory Committee is a multidisciplinary group, comprised of representatives from
appropriate use organizations (e.g, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health,
Choosing Wisely Canada, Canadian Medication Appropriateness and Deprescribing Network)
clinicians, patients, and the public, who bring a diversity of expertise and perspectives to the table.
The committee is chaired by Stephen Samis, the former Deputy Minister for Health and Social
Services for the Yukon.
The Advisory Committee has been mandated to bring together representatives from appropriate
use organizations, clinician and patient communities, and stakeholders, to:
Support the development of a pan-Canadian strategy for appropriate use to provide a common
vision for the design, implementation and evaluation of programs and initiatives.
Advise and provide recommendations on the roles and responsibilities for the CDA appropriate use
program to provide the greatest value and impact to the existing landscape.
Develop a process and identify priority areas to be addressed by the CDA appropriate use
resources.
The Advisory Committee issued an Interim Report in July 2023 with early guidance on the core
components of a pan-Canadian appropriate use strategy and the framework for a CDA appropriate
use program.
The CDATO facilitatedconsultations on the Interim Report, to hear the perspectives of partners
including, clinicians, patients, industry members, and health system partners. Feedback and
comments will help inform the Advisory Committee’s continued work and final advice and
recommendations.
A final report is expected in Spring 2024. Pharmacare Legislation
On February 29, 2024, the Government of Canada introduced pharmacare legislation to the House
of Commons that features appropriate use. This legislation requires that the Minister of Health
publish a pan-Canadian strategy regarding the appropriate use of prescription drugs and related
products within one year of the bill receiving royal ascent. The draft legislation also specifies that
the Minister of Health may request that three years after its publication the CDA prepare a report on
the progress made inadvancing the strategy.
14.CANADIAN DRUG AGENCY
ISSUE
On December 18, 2023, the Government of Canada announced its plan to advance with the
establishment of the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA, the Agency), built from the Canadian Agency for
Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and in partnership with provincesand territories,
featuring an investment of $89.5 million over five years, starting in 2024-25. The CDA will provide
the dedicated leadership and coordination needed to modernize the Canadian pharmaceutical
system, laying a strong foundation to support ongoing growth. The CDA is also featured in Bill C-64,
an Act respecting pharmacare, which signals plans to task the Agency with work on formulary
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
development, a bulk purchasing strategy, and to support the publication of a pan-Canadian
strategy on the appropriate use of medications.
KEY FACTS
Key reports on the future of the Canadian pharmaceuticals system recommended the creation of a
new national drug agency that would build on existing provincial and territorial successes and take
a coordinated approach to improving system management.
The Canadian Drug Agency Transition Office was established in spring 2021 to work with provinces,
territories and key stakeholders on options for a Canadian Drug Agency (CDA); supported by a
Budget 2019 investment of $35 million over four years.
In December 2021, the Prime Minister reinforced the commitment to creating the CDA in the
Minister of Health’s mandate letter, stating the government would “continue engaging with willing
provinces and territories towards national universal pharmacare, while proceeding with a national
strategy on high-cost drugs for rare diseases and advancingthe establishment of the Canada [sic]
Drug Agency.”
In March 2022, the Prime Minister elaborated on the mandate of the CDA in the Supply and
Confidence Agreement with the New Democratic Party of Canada, announcing the CDA will
“develop a national formulary of essential medicines and bulk purchasing plan by the end of the
agreement” in 2025. This commitment was reiterated in Budget 2022.
Work to develop a proposal for establishing a CDA has been informed by analysis of the current
pharmaceuticals management system and significant engagement, including over 400 meetings
and roundtables with all provinces and territories, and hundreds of stakeholders such as
healthcare professionals, patient organizations, and industry.
KEY MESSAGES
We are advancing with plans to establish the Canadian Drug Agency (CDA), built from the Canadian
Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), in partnership with provinces and territories
and stakeholders. This is supported by an investment of $89.5 million over 5 years, starting in 2024-
25.
The CDA will build on CADTH’s expertise and mandate, establishing a strong foundation to support
evolving system priorities, focusing first on:
Appropriate prescribing and use; Data and analytics; and
System Coordination.
The CDA will build onCADTH’s existing work to integrate patients and those with lived experience.
The CDA is featured in Bill C-64, an Act respecting pharmacare; the Act provides that the new CDA
work towards the development of a national formulary, develop a national bulk purchasing strategy,
and to support the publication of a pan-Canadian strategy regarding the appropriate use of
medications.
IF PRESSED ON THE NEED FOR A CANADIAN DRUG AGENCY
Canada has internationally recognized pockets of excellence in pharmaceuticals management,
including the regulatory approvals process within Health Canada.
The CDA will focus on the system as a whole to address gaps, remove duplication, improve system
coordination and enhance access and equity.
More specifically, the CDA’s core functions will include:
Appropriate Prescribing and Use; Data and Analytics; and
System Coordination
Through these functions, the CDA will provide the dedicated leadership and capacity that is needed
to implement national priorities to improve the pharmaceuticals system.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
The CDA will not duplicate well-performing functions or organizations. IF PRESSED ON
PHARMACARE LEGISLATION
The Government of Canada is committed to working with stakeholders to advance the
implementation of pharmacare. The creation of the CDA will address key system gaps and lay a
strong foundation upon which future pharmacare work can be built, including formulary
development and a bulk purchasing strategy.
We will continue to engage with stakeholders and key partners to establish the CDA so that it is
well-positioned to advance work related to the pharmacare legislation, as required.
IF PRESSED ON RESULTS TO DATE
The Government of Canada has been working closely with provinces and territories and key
stakeholders to develop a plan to create a CDA.
The Canadian Drug Agency Transition Office (CDATO) was established in 2021 to lead this work,
and has since undertaken significant engagement–over 400 meetings and roundtables–with
patients, pharmaceutical companies, insurers, prescribers and academicson a future CDA.
The CDATO has advanced work with key partners to support development of CDA functions.
The Government of Canada will continue to work closely with CADTH and key partners to advance
the establishment of the CDA.
IF PRESSED ONRESPECTING PROVINCIAL AND TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION
Provincial and territorial healthcare systems, including public drug plans, are facing mounting
pressure, exacerbated by the pandemic.
Our approach will focus on filling gaps, improving access, and system sustainability.
The CDA will respect provincial and territorial jurisdiction and will not duplicate well-performing
functions and organizations.
Federal, provincial, territorial collaboration is the cornerstone of our approach for establishing the
CDA, and we will continue to work collaboratively with jurisdictions toward its launch.
BACKGROUND
Budget Commitments
Budget 2019 announced federal investments to move forward on three foundational elements of
national pharmacare:
Creation of a Canadian DrugAgency to take a coordinated approach towards assessing
effectiveness and negotiating drug prices;
As part of the work of the Agency, development of a national formulary to promote more consistent
coverage across the country; and,
Creation of a national strategy for drugs for rare diseases to help Canadians get better access to the
effective treatments they need.
Budget 2019 proposed $35 million over four years, starting in 2019-20, to establish a Transition
Office to support this initiative. It also announced an investment of up to $1 billion over two years,
starting in 2022-23, with up to $500 million per year ongoing, to help Canadians with rare diseases
access the drugs they need.
These commitments were reiterated in the 2020 Fall Economic Statement, Budget 2021 and Budget
2022.
On December 18, 2023 the Government of Canada announced approved funding of $89.5 million
over 5 years, beginning in 2024-25, to establish a Canadian Drug Agency (CDA).
The Canadian Drug Agency will be established as a not-for-profit pan-Canadian health organization,
built with, and from, the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and in
partnership with provinces and territories.

CADTH
CADTH was established in 1989 as an independent pan-Canadian health organization, governed by
a Board of Directors with representation from 7 jurisdictions and non-governmental entities.
CADTH reports directly to the 13 PT Deputy Ministers of Health.
CADTH provides Canada’s health care decision-makers with objective evidence, including health
technology assessments and post-market safety and effectiveness work, support informed
decisions about the optimal use of drugs and medical devices.
CADTH’s 2022-2025 Strategic Plan has supported growth and innovation, promoting innovative
approaches and positioning the organization as a catalyst for system change. Growing capacity
underscored by the recent successful integration of the Post-Market Drug Evaluation (PMDE)
program, formerly situated with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Bill C-64
On February 29, 2024 the Minister of Health introduced Bill C-64, An Act respecting pharmacare
(Pharmacare Act), which proposes the foundational principles for the first phase of national
universal pharmacare in Canada and describes the Government of Canada’s intent to work with
provinces and territories to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a number of contraception
and diabetes medications.
Bill C-64 also provides that the new Canadian Drug Agency work towards the development of a
national formulary, develop a national bulk purchasing strategy, and support the publication of a
pan-Canadian strategy regarding the appropriate use of prescription medications.
External Perspectives Media and Public Opinion
Canadians are generally supportive of improving affordable access to prescription drugs but are
also sensitive to cost considerations as government health-related expenses continue to grow,
particularly in the context of COVID-19.
Mainstream media coverage of the pharmaceuticals system focuses primarily on approval of new
treatments, science-based innovation, clinical trail breakthroughs, and accessibility / affordability
of treatments from a human interest perspective.
Media reports are generally factual and link the mandate letter and related federal Budget
announcements. Select media emphasize Quebec’s unique approach to health.
A May 2022 Fraser Institute poll following the federal budget, found that 79% of Canadians support
universal national pharmacare with no costs attached. Support fell by almost half, to 40%, if the
program was to be financed by an increase in the GST.
An October 2020 Angus Reid study found that one quarter (26%) of Canadians had to pay for half or
more of their prescription drug costs in the past year. Nearly nine-in-ten Canadians supported the
idea (86%) of an affordable drugs program and more than seven-in-ten (77%) said increasing
coverage should be a high priority for government.
Stakeholders
The stakeholder ecosystem for the pharmaceuticals management system is very large and diverse,
including patients, patient organizations, Indigenous representatives, healthcare professionals,
prescribers, dispensers, scientists and researchers, employers and employees, and innovative and
generic manufacturers. Stakeholder engagement has been neutral to positive, with many signalling
willingness to discuss further collaboration.
Some stakeholders, including brand name manufacturers and unions, have developed written
input to share their perspectives on the mandate and role of a CDA.
Industry emphasizes priorities such as accelerating approvals processes, support for innovation, a
data-driven approach to technology assessment, value analysis, and assessing treatment
outcomes.
Provinces and territories
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Through the Council of the Federation, provincial and territorial Premiers publicly and persistently
call on the federal government to increase funding for healthcare through the Canada Health
Transfer (CHT),
Premiers sometimes note pharmaceuticals among the priority areas, including in July 2022.
Pharmaceuticals Management Landscape
In recent years, decisions related to system management have been driven by rapidly evolving
system demands, new technologies, and evolving international market factors that have been
challenging to reconcile with the traditional division of responsibilities and the provisions of the
Canada Health Act.
This has resulted in gaps, challenges, and inefficiencies particularly in relation to: Coordination

Part C: Background
15.Backgrounder: Universal Access to Contraception February 29,2024
Today, the Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health, announced the Government of Canada’s
next step toward national universal pharmacare with the introduction of Bill C-64, An Act respecting
pharmacare, into Parliament, and the intention to provide universal, single-payer coverage for a
range of contraception medications and devices in collaboration with provinces and territories(PTs)
Contraceptives
Contraception, also known as birth control, is used to prevent pregnancy. In Canada, there are
more than 9 million people of reproductive age, nearly one quarter of the Canadian population.
Contraceptive drugs were chosen as part of this next step of universal pharmacare specifically
because improved access to contraception improves equality. It reduces the risk of unintended
pregnancies and improves reproductive rights.
Cost has been identified by Canadian contraceptive care providers as the single most important
barrier to access to these medications. Oral contraceptives cost approximately $25 per unit, or
$300 per year. Intrauterine Devices (IUDs), which are effective for five years, cost approximately up
to $500 per unit.
Cost can discourage people both from accessing contraception, and from choosing more effective
methods of contraception with a higher upfront cost. For example, oral contraceptives have a
typical use failure rate of 9% compared to 0.20% for IUDs. Not having affordable access to effective
contraception can increase the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can impact life plans such
as going to school and advancing in one’s career.
Some populations are disproportionally affected by the lack of coverage. Women, people with low
incomes and young people, all of whom are all more likely to work in part‑time or contract
positions, often lack access to private coverage. One study found that women and girls from lower-
income households are more likely to use less-effective contraceptive methods or no contraceptive
method.
Although most drug plans list a range of contraceptive products, only a fraction of Canadians are
eligible for prescription birth control at low or no cost through a public drug plan. If they do not have
drug coverage through an employment-based private health benefit plan, Canadians would
typically have access to only a public safety net coverage plan intended to protect residents from
very high drug costs. The high deductibles under these plans (e.g., 3-20% of household income), in
addition to co-payments, mean these plans typically offer little relief for routine drug expenses,
such as contraception.
Studies have demonstrated that publicly funded no-cost universal contraception can result in
public cost savings. Evidence from the University of British Columbia (BC) estimated that no-cost
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
contraception has the potential to save the BC health care system approximately $27 million per
year.
Types of Contraceptives Being Covered
Today’s announcement will ensure that, following agreement with PTs, people in Canada will have
access to a comprehensive suite of contraceptive drugs and devices to choose from according to
their medical suitability and personal circumstances.
This includes oral contraceptives, copper and hormonal IUDs, injections, implants, rings, and
morning-after pills.
The Government of Canada will be launching discussions with PTs on providing universal, single-
payer coverage based on the list of contraceptive drugs and devices attached to this backgrounder.

16.Backgrounder: Universal Access to Diabetes
Medications, and Diabetes Device Fund for Devices and Supplies February 29, 2024
Today, the Honourable Mark Holland, Minister of Health, announced the Government of Canada’s
next step toward thefirst phase of national universal pharmacare with the introduction of Bill C-64,
An Act respecting pharmacare, into Parliament, and the intention to provide universal, single-payer
coverage for a range of diabetes medications in collaboration with willingprovinces and territories
(PTs).
In addition, the federal government is announcing its intention to establish a fund to enable work
with PT partners to support Canadians’ access to supplies that diabetics require to manage and
monitor their condition and administer their medication, suchas syringes and glucose test strips.
Diabetes medications
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting people living in Canada. Around
3.7 million people in Canada, or 9.4% of the population, live with diagnosed diabetes. The number
of people living with diabetes has doubled over the last decade and is expected to continue to
increase as Canada's population ages and grows.
In 2015, 25% of Canadians with diabetes indicated following their treatments were affected by
cost, in some cases rationing medications to save money. Uncontrolled diabetes can have very
serious short and long-term health impacts and represents a burden toindividuals, families, and
Canadian society. High and unnecessary costs are incurred from lost productivity and elevated
health-care system use due to diabetes and its complications, including heart attack, stroke,
kidney failure, blindness and amputation. The full cost of diabetes to the healthcare system in 2018
is estimated to be around $27 billion and could exceed $39 billion by 2028.
Diabetes is a chronic condition that develops when the body either does not produce or effectively
use insulin, which it needs to turn sugar into energy. Diabetes can lead to serious health
complications if not properly managed.
Unclassified / Nonclassifié
Diabetes disproportionately affects certain populations within Canada. Evidence shows that First
Nations and Métis people, and people of African, East Asian and South Asian ethnic backgrounds
have higher rates of Type 2 diabetes compared to the general population.
There are three major types of diabetes, each with different causes and sometimes different
treatments:
Type 1 diabetes happens when the body stops producing insulin. Type 1 diabetes usually develops
in childhood or early adulthood. About 5 to 10% of people living with diabetes have type 1.
Type 2 diabetes happens when the body does not make enough insulin or does not respond well to
the insulin it makes. People usually receive a diagnosis for Type 2 diabetes after the age of 40, but it
is becoming more common in younger people. About90% to 95% of people living with diabetes
have type 2.
Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy and disappears after
delivery. Gestational diabetes develops in about 10% of pregnancies.
There is currently no cure for diabetes, but some treatments may help to manage it and improve
quality of life.
Types of Diabetes Medications Being Covered
Today’s announcement would ensure that, following agreement with PTs, diabetics in Canada will
have access to first-line treatments for diabetes that lower blood glucose levels, including:
Insulin, which is used by patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Insulin can cost in the range of
$900-$1,700 per year, depending on the type and dosage required.
Metformin, which is used by patients with type 2 diabetes. Metformin can cost about$100 per year.
Medications often used in combination with insulin and metformin by patients with type 2 diabetes,
includingSulfonylureas, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. The cost of these medications can range from
approximately $100 to over $1,000 per year.
Existing drug insurance coverage for diabetes medications and supplies varies widely across
Canada. All PTs include many of the commonly-prescribed drugs to treat diabetes on their
formularies although the cost to the patient can vary greatly.
Improving the affordability of these medications will improve the health of Canadians living with
diabetes and reduce the risk of serious life-changing health complications such as blindness or
amputations.
The Government of Canada will be launching discussions with PTs on providing universal, single-
payer coverage based on the list of diabetes drugs attached to this backgrounder.

Diabetes devices and supplies
Canadians using insulin require the necessary equipment to administer their medication. This can
include syringes, insulin pens and pen tips, or insulin pumps and supplies such as insertion sets
and insulin cartridges.
People living with diabetes must also closely monitor their blood sugar levels to ensure their sugar
levels are in a safe range, and to adjust their medication as needed. Equipment to monitor sugar
levels can include glucometers, test strips and lancets, as well as flash and continuous glucose
monitoring devices (CGM). Use of CGM or Flash GM devices leads to fewer complications and
reduces long-term costs associated with hospitalization.
These devices and supplies can cost thousands of dollars per year. All PTs offer some form of
coverage or financial assistance for diabetes-related medical devices and supplies but the
programs vary in terms of the support provided and eligibility.
Separate from Bill C-64, the federal government is announcing its intention to establish a fund to
support access to diabetes devices and supplies. Further details regarding this fund will be
provided following discussions with PT partners, who will be essential partners to its roll out.
