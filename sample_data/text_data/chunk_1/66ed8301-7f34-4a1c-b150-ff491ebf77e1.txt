Notes: Fine Particulate Matter (also known as PM2.5) are particles in the air that measure less than 2.5 micrometers (μm) in diameter, and typically consists of a mix of things like smoke, soot, liquid or solid particles in aerosol, or biological matter like mould, bacteria, pollen and animal dander. PM2.5 poses a risk to your health because, when inhaled, it can travel deeply into your lungs.
