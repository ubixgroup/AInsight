Notes: The summary data table of estimates of usual intakes for energy, nutrients & other dietary components from food uses data collected from Canadians in the 2004 and 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Nutrition. Data are provided for the household population by 16 DRI age–sex groups at the national, regional and provincial levels.

Please note that the following estimates have been updated December 2024: 
Estimates of usual intakes of folate (mcg/d (Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE)) for 2015 at the national level were revised based on updated calculation of DFE content of recipes in the nutrient database. The following were not revised: national estimates (2004), and provincial- or regional- estimates (2004, 2015). As such, it is not possible to compare national-level estimates between 2004 and 2015 or compare provincial and national-level estimates for 2015.

This tool presents usual intakes of energy, nutrients and other dietary components using data collected in the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey â Nutrition. It highlights where Canadiansâ intakes fall relative to Dietary Reference Intakes established by the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. About the data Distribution curves Geographic comparison Data table Technical Notes About the Data Tool The Nutrition Surveillance Data Tool presents usual intakes of energy, nutrients and other dietary components using data collected in the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey â Nutrition (CCHS â Nutrition). The goal is to complement the full usual intake dataset published on the Government of Canadaâs Open Data portal by presenting key data in an interactive and user-friendly way. This data tool enables users to look at the 2015 CCHS â Nutrition usual intake data in three ways. Distribution curves In a graph that displays the usual intake distribution among Canadians for a nutrient and age-sex group of interest and where these intakes fall relative to Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). View Distribution curves Geographic comparison On a map of Canada that shows the percentage of children, adolescents and adults in each province consuming inadequate or excessive intakes of nutrients of interest. View Geographic comparison Data table In a customizable table that presents usual intake distributions for nutrient, age-sex group(s) and region(s) of interest.
