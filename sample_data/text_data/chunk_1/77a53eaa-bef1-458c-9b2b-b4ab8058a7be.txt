The purpose of this Compliance Verification (CV) project was to verify industry's compliance of alcohol-based fuel products with the requirements of the Consumer Chemicals and Containers Regulations, 2001 (CCCR, 2001) and sections 7 and 8 of the CCPSA, which states that consumer products that pose a danger to human health or safety are prohibited from sale. Based on the danger considerations discussed in the Danger Determination Notice sent to interested parties in the fall of 2019, Health Canada believes that certain containers of pourable alcohol-based fuel that do not have a functional flame mitigation device for the useful life of the product pose a danger to human health or safety under the CCPSA. For this project, compliance of select alcohol-based fuel products with the CCCR, 2001 were determined through a review of establishment records requested by Health Canada inspectors. Compliance to the CCPSA was determined through the verification of the presence of Flame Mitigation Devices (FMD) on select alcohol-based fuel products. Prior to initiating this CV project, the CPSP carried out market intelligence and inspections to determine the presence of alcohol-based fuel product companies in Canada. Targets were then selected from that list of companies. During this project, 15 different products were visually evaluated for the presence of a FMD and their CCCR, 2001 documentation was reviewed. The evaluation resulted in 3 recalls due to the lack of a FMD and 1 voluntary commitment to address non-compliance to the CCCR, 2001. There were 8 instances where no corrective action was required and 3 instances where the products were determined not to meet the scope of the project. Results Readers should consult the individual recall and safety notices, if applicable, for details of the products subject to this enforcement action.

Products are not randomly selected but are chosen because they are deemed by the inspector to be more likely to not meet health and safety requirements due to characteristics that are observed. Due to this biased nature and the fact that evaluation sizes within CE projects are very small, the findings of CE projects are not intended to reflect overall market compliance unless otherwise stated. Note that these summary reports relate only to the product(s) actually evaluated and the specific criteria indicated. Evaluation by Health Canada does not represent approval or endorsement of the product(s).
